title: 'Indestructible Art 36: Save Ryan!'
subtitle: "Tragedy strikes the IA crew and one member goes missing. The crew pushes on with an insightful conversation about an all digital future. MGS 5 confirmed by Kojima, Nintendo launches the 3DS XL, and DC conducts a reader survey."
summary: "IA welcomes friend of the show, Tony, to come and talk about the books he’s been reading. Big news comes out of a Nintendo media event including the  3DS XL, Hideo Kojima spills some beans on MGS5, and Evan goes all in on a Darksiders II Onlive system bundle. The gang tries to figure out what goes on behind the scenes of DC’s recent reader survey and no one seems to be too thrilled about the new Madefire comic book reader. The episode wraps up with a roundtable on Saga #4 and a back and forth about Alan Moore and Before Watchmen."
