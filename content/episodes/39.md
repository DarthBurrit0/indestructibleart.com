summary: "This week Ryan and Spencer share their feelings on the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, Neil Gaiman's return to Sandman, Marvel's post AvX plans, and Batman Earth One. Omar and Evan try and figure out the Ouya, get excited for Valve's Steam Greenlight, and nerd over tons of new Borderlands 2 news. Evan is unsure what a Silver Age Batman game from Rocksteady would offer, while Ryan and Spencer get excited for the possibilities of a Waid and Yu Hulk book. We get a break down of the 2012 Eisner award winners, discussion of legendary comic Planetary, and a recorded listener question from good friend and great fan Brad Stemke."
