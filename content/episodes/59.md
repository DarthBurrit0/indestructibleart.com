subtitle: "Hey friends, this episode is long. Like really long, but it was all so good I couldn't find parts to take out. So maybe take breaks? It's awesome and i'm sure your going to enjoy the heck out of it. So pace yourself and don't let the length scare you."
summary: "Hey friends, this episode is long. Like really long, but it was all so good I couldn't find parts to take out. So maybe take breaks? It's awesome and i'm sure your going to enjoy the heck out of it. So pace yourself and don't let the length scare you. Evan questions Ryan's motives. Omar looks for depth in time travel. Spencer wants to see more of Hulk Hogan. Ryan looks good in a wig. Like I said, it's all awesome. Enjoy."
