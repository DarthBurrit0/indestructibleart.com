title: 'Indestructible Art 49: BYO Chair'
subtitle: "There once was a story all about how a podcast studio got turned all upside down."
summary: "The crew finds a nice quiet corner to sit and chat amongst the deconstruction of IA home base. Ryan and Spencer hope that Uncanny X-Force continues its strong run into Marvel NOW. Evan is saddened by the retirement of the Bioware Doctors, but is buoyed by Nintendo's adoption of the Unity Framework. Spencer talks numbers on canceling books and the responsibility of the news sites have when reporting them. News of the new even slimmer PS3 comes just in time to save Omar from a dying PS3 BigBoy. Spencer and Omar argue with Ryan on the worth of DC's Frankenstein Agent of SHADE. The group talks Picks of the Week and the lack of Listener Questions."
