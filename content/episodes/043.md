summary: "Spencer and Omar are absent this episode but Evan and Ryan get into enough trouble on their own figuring out who would play the IA cast in a Hollywood blockbuster movie and arguing about the science of Ant man. A new Fantastic Four is assembled and a new Super Man family cross over is in the works. Omar phones in on Skype to talk about Sound Shapes, Darksiders, and Airmech."
