title: 'Indestructible Art 57: One Word Teasers'
subtitle: "We've got another great episode for you guys this week. We sort of threw the normal schedule out the window and just started chating about stuff, and some news and then more stuff. Check it out."
summary: "This week we dive into the presumably rocky launch of the Nintendo WiiU. Be it game or feature nothing was safe from the wrath of the internet. Ryan tells us of new old Marvel villain, Dog Logan. Evan is excited for PS Plus to come to the Vita. Spencer defends his rights to One Word Teasers. Omar sneaks in yet another Kickstarter campaign he thinks you should back. Then we get into a big helping of things we read and played, and cap it off with some Picks of the Week."
