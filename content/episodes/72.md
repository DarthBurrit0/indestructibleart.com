title: "Indestructible Art 72: Then There Was Three"
subtitle: "How much does a video game character cost to make? Will PS4 charge it's install base to play used games? Why is Marvel trolling DC so hard? Is Damien Wayne really dead? We don't have all the answers either but we sure like to talk about stuff."
summary: "It's another game of musical chairs this week as Omar steps outs and leaves Ryan, Spencer, and Evan to their own devices. An uproar ensues when Lab Zero asks for 150k to fund a new Skullgirls character, the future for PS4 and used games is still undetermined, Damian Wayne gets stabbed, and Marvels new marketing campaign uses DC's sacred number 52. Stick around for Spencer's rant on the prospects of Nolan-verse Batman being integrated into the new Justice League movie."
