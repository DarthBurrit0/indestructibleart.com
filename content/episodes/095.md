title: "Indestructible Art 95: Omar After Dark"
subtitle: "Carmack becomes the new CTO of Oculus Rift, John Romita Jr. is leaving Marvel Comics, more Dragon's Crown nonsense, July comic book numbers, and Batman: Arkham Origins multiplayer gets detailed."
summary: "By day he is a sun loving life guard protecting the California coast...but once the sun goes down over Santa Monica, he is a man who plays by his own rules. This is the dangerous true story of one Cuban lifeguard that trades in his rescue whistle for a badge. Armed with only his wits, rescue can, a veggie burrito, and unquenchable thirst for Justice, the man only known as Omar fights for love, truth, Wi-Fi hotspots, and the oppressed. Framed for murder, he now prowls Santa Monica...Justice on the beach, Justice on the Streets. He is....OMAR AFTER DARK!"
