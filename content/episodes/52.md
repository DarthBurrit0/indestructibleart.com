title: 'Indestructible Art 52: One Year Down, Infinity to Go'
subtitle: "One year... Man it's crazy how fast time flies. Thanks for being here with us. It means a lot. Seriously. "
summary: "This week we talk about New York Comic-Con. A Wii price cut. Yet another reason to be mad at EA. More Scott Snyder, more Borderlands, and get into our Listener Question contest. Winners were picked. Questions were answered. Enjoy it, we did. And again, we can say it enough, thanks so much for being here with us through the first year of Indestructible Art. We've had a great time and hope you have too. Here's looking forward to sharing more awesome stuff in the years to come."
