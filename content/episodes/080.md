subtitle: "Nintendo bows out of their annual major E3 press event, C2E2 2013 comes packed with announcements, and another Vlambeer game gets cloned."
summary: "Another day another podcast. The crew gets into a heated conversation about whether Nintendo is making the right move by opting out of a big E3 press event and this year's C2E2 unleashes a flurry of announcements. What's the difference between influence and theft? We talk about Vlambeer's latest game Luftausers getting cloned on iOS. Then stick around for a round table about East of West 2 and picks of the week."
