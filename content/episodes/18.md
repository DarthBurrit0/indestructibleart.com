title: 'Indestructible Art 18: All Ages'
subtitle: 'Activision doesn’t blacklist a game blog, we don’t talk about Diablo 3, and a new segment premieres on Indestructible Art this week...one of those statements is not like the others.'
summary: 'Marvel starts a comic series aimed at kids, Ryan premiers the new Indestructible Art segment Modern Master pieces with comic sensation Y The Last Man, and ends the show with a peculiar bit of news. Evan gives the lowdown on some more vita launch games, poorly explains why Marvels new series is not all ages, and talks about why you probably shouldn’t get a 3G model of the Vita. Stick around for an awesome listener question!'
