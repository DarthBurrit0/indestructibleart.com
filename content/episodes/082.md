title: "Indestructible Art 82: Sweet Chin Music"
subtitle: "Silicon Knights sells a ton of stuff to a new studio that's Kickstarting a spiritual successor to Eternal Darkness, Grant Morrison says some stuff about Wonder Woman Earth One, and Patrice Desilets is fired from Ubisoft."
summary: "Rogue moons and the geographical location of Satan's butt assault IA this week. Denis Dyack is up to something with his new company and Kickstarter campaign both of which have the goal of making a spiritual sequel to Eternal Darkness. Grant Morrison talks a little bit about what we can expect from Wonder Woman Earth 1 and for some reason the IA crew gets sucked into the discussion about Marvel's rendition of Angela. Picks of the Week followed by Ryan and Omar trying to crack the code on Chin Music."
