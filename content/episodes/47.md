subtitle: "Evan, Ryan, and Omar waste no time getting to wasting time in this weeks episode. This week: Adventure Time, Starcraft 2, Steam Greenlight, PS Vita, PSN v XBLA, Scott Snyder, Marvel Now, Baltimore Comic Con, and Picks of the Week."
summary: "This week's heat fueled stupor is brought to you by the fine folks at The Sun. The crew laments the passing of an era as they outgrow the underwater sanctuary that was the Indestructible Art Studios and look toward a bigger brighter future on Volcano Rocket Ship Skull Island. But then it's back to business as usual as Ryan gets even more excited for what could be in Scott Snyder's rumored Superman: Man of Steel. Evan lays out the coming month of Video Game releases, all of which pale in the light that is Borderlands 2. More Marvel NOW teasers leave Ryan scratching his non-bald capped head. Fantastic Arcade will host an Adventure Time themed Game Jam which sounds, well, fantastic. Ryan tries to get the group excited for The (new) Avengers lineup. Rumors of a 2014 Xbox release sparks debate on the future of XBLA v PSN. Finally Omar closes out the show with this week's Picks of the Week, Mark of the ninja on XBLA and the zero issues for Animal Man and Swamp Thing."
