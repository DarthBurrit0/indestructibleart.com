number: 77
title: "Indestructible Art 77: Undertaking The Right to Bare Arms"
subtitle: "Rumors point fingers at Microsoft and their potential always online requirement, Disney shuts down LucasArts, DC details the Trinity War, and Ryan runs down the comic book sales numbers for March."
summary: "The IA crew jumps in feet first this week with news completely unrelated to games and comic books. No need to worry though! We still get to the good stuff. Evan tries to step into the mind of Shaun White, Ryan is heavily invested in Wrestlemania after a rough break up with his comic shop, Spencer can't stop listening to Carly Rae Jepsen and Omar tries to cope with a parallel reality in which he finds himself without sleeves. The crew talks a bit about BioShock Infinite, Saga 11, and of course picks of the week."
