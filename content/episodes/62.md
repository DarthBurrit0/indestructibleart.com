subtitle: "Happy Holidays Everybody! Not sure we said it even once during the show, but do know, we wish you and yours a great season and happy times all around."
summary: "This week we get into some long discussions about digital comics and the state of the games industry. I found it quite interesting. Evan likes what the new Humble Bundle has to offer. Spencer is amazed at Comixology earnings. Omar is optimistic about THQ news, and Ryan tells the group about Batgirl's new writer. And finally we end the show with some Pick's of the Week."
