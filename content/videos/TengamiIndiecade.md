subtitle: "A small group of Ex-Rare developers put together an indie team and have begun working on a game called Tengami. Phillip Tossel is one of the games creators and he tells us all about the design process behind Tengami, using development experience with Kinect to make a better iOS game, and the reasons a developer might want to leave a studio like Rare to become part of their own indie dream team."
