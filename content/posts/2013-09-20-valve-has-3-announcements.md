<p>Valve has launched a <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/">teaser site</a> with a count down timer and a simple statement, "The Steam Universe is Expanding in 2014." We all knew it was only a matter of time before Steam left the confines of our PC monitors and attempted world domination. It looks like that assault is about to officially begin in the living room.

<p>Although Steam has already launched <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/bigpicture/">Big Picture</a>, "a user-interface tailored for televisions and gamepads", it's not quite enough to get those of us huddled in our corner of the universe clutching onto our consoles to jump ship. Below the countdown is another statement that reads:</p>

<p>"This year we've been working on even more ways to connect the dots for customers who want Steam in the living-room.
Soon, we'll be adding you to our design process, so that you can help us shape the future of Steam."</p>

<p>We have been hearing rumors about a Steam box for a while now, and eventually those rumors were cleared up by <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/8/3852144/gabe-newell-interview-steam-box-future-of-gaming">official statements</a> explaining what Steam Box would actually be. All of that talk is finally coming to a head and it appears we are going to know a lot more about all of this by the end of next week.</p>

<p>According to some <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/381097222307192832">members of the press</a> Valve will be making three announcements over the next week. The first announcement is to come Monday around 10am PST, and the rest are alleged to follow shortly after.</p>

<p>Of course with an emphasis on the number three you don't have to go as far as NeoGAF to see that the Half Life 3 hype train is back on track. I am of the firm belief that we would see a Team Fortress 3, a Left 4 Dead 3, or even a Portal 3 before that fateful day Valve finally calms the masses. Then again...that Cat in the picture has two whiskers on one side and 3 on the other...perhaps HL2 Episode 3 isn't totally out of the question? Look at the image of that moon...doesn't that ring look like a blue portal? How about the craters...don't they look suspiciously like one of the robot companions from Portal 2. The little circles also kind of resemble personality cores...</p>

<p>In all seriousness, If I had to guess I'd say the first announcement is probably a moderately high end PC equipped specifically for playing Steam games on a television or a monitor. The second announcement may be a smaller device that hooks up to a television and then allows you to stream games from your PC to that TV. Lastly, I would assume the third announcement is some type of software launch or perhaps a partnership announcement.</p>

<p>It makes sense that Valve would launch a game alongside their new living room initiative and they certainly have a solid stable of franchises to pull from. As far as rumors go I have seen everything from Oculus Rift and OnLive buyouts to someone over laying the suspicious looking circles to form the word DOTA. Considering the wording of the second statement on the teaser site it's not too far fetched to think Valve might try releasing a new tool to further inspire user generated content. Especially since it seems like every time Gabe Newell <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzn6E2m3otg">speaks in public</a> he reminds us how powerful the Steam user base can be and how much Valve respects that power.</p>

<p>What's on your Steam announcement wish-list? What games or types of things would you like to see announced next week?</p>
