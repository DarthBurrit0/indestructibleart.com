####The Story
I've had the itch to build a good gaming PC for a while now but haven't bit down yet because of the cost. As you can see from that nifty table up there it's still a little high at $1,345.91, but that is way down from the near $2K rigs I'd been pricing out before. This seems like a good medium-high end machine to aspire to. 

The parts in the chart above come partly from [this article](http://www.tested.com/tech/pcs/454052-small-quiet-fast-building-modern-gaming-pc/) on Tested.com and partly what I think I would want in a machine. The question now is what can be cut to save some money but not hamper the performance of the machine in a way that would bother me during game play. I've included links to NewEgg for the parts to make it easier to compare to more cost effective parts. 

####Where to Spend
Let's start where I think it's smart to spend a little more money.  
  
#####CPU/MoBo/Memory  
The CPU, and because of that the motherboard, is likely going to outlive any other part of the PC. So it makes sense to me to just go for it here and opt for one of the top models you can afford. This [Intel i7](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116501) is like one step down from the top of the line available now. Buying high here will give up more upgrade paths later on making refreshing the machine easier. The MoBo is mainly attractive for the size. At first glance it seems like it leaves very little room to work with later on but if you think about what we need form a dedicated gaming PC it has everything we need. One slot for a video card and two slots for some decently fast memory and I think we're good to go.

####Where to Save
Now we get some parts where we can make some cuts for cost.  
  
#####Case
You could probably go cheaper with the case, but not by much and I'd want to make sure there was room enough to keep the CPU and Video cool. There are a few different options for Mini-ITX, being Desktop or Tower. I like tower, seems easier to work in and probably better for air flow.
  
#####Power Supply
The PSU in my list was chosen based on the recommendation in the tested article. I like that its fully modular and has a mode to run the fan more silently. The former just makes sense based on the size of the case. I remember in my old PCs the crazy amount of space that was taken up by the extra cables coming out of the PSU. It was super dumb. The latter catches my eye because of how the PC will be used. This thing is going to be sitting next to my TV. I don't need another jet engine (i.e. og Xbox360) sounding off in my media center. This idea will play into other decisions during the build. If these options are not important to you can probably find something in the $60 to $100 range. [This one](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817153167) is $75 and seems like it could handle the rest of the build.
  
#####CPU Cooler
Like I said before, I don't want this thing to sound like a jet engine. To that I want to use a contained water cooling system. The Intel system makes it on the list over other products mainly because its made by Intel and the brand makes my brain feel better. There are cheaper ones for sale but only by ~$20. The other route is to use a fan cooler, and from what I've read the stock in the box CPU fan are not that bad. It will most likely be louder but you can save the $78 by forgoing the water cooler.
  
#####Hard Drive
The hard drive, and the video card later, pose a tougher decision. SSD for speed, HD for cost and space, or both for a mix of size and speed. I chose one larger SSD for ease and speed. SSDs are crazy fast and quiet, and they crossed that line of cost per gig that makes not going SSD seem silly. You could do a smaller SSD and a larger HD for storage, but then you'd be in charge of moving files between the two drives to keep the most used things on the SSD and everything else on the HD for storage, annoying. If you would rather not bother with SSD at all then one large HD will save you a couple hundred dollars easy.
  
#####Video Card
The video card and CPU will make the biggest difference in system performance. So why is this something you can cut costs on? It's because this is one of the easiest things you can replace to boost performance and refresh the machine. You can save a ton of money on a video card if all you want is something to play games at 1080p. Sure a top of the line card will pump out 1080 at 80fps or something just as gnarly, but the cost near $1k. For under $300 you can get a card that will blow away what you see from current gen consoles. Then in a year or whatever you spend another $300, get another bump in graphic performance and still have spent less then a crazy $1k card. I'm still not too sure where I land on these mid-high cards. I'm sure the sweet spot is somewhere in the 660 to 680 range.  
  
####Conclusion
It's easy to see why people get turned off of building a gaming rig based on the cost. My list comes out to just over $1,300, which is still quite a lot of money. Get that down around $800, and it becomes much more appealing. For me this is more of a wish list, because c'mon $1,300. But the more I make a list like this and the more I look at different parts, the more I understand where I can save money and it comes closer to becoming a real build.
  
So who wants to give me $1300??...
