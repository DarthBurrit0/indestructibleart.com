# Spencer Carnage's Top 10 Video Games and Comics of 2013

You know the drill.

##10. [Hotline Miami](http://hotlinemiami.com/)
Something about this game makes you feel like you’re playing out an action scene in a Tarrantino movie. And that soundtrack! Man, does that thing groove. Every level is a one shot, one kill parade of violence that will have you pressing the X button over and over again as you restart the level, inching that much closer to the perfect dance of death needed to sweep through a couple of rooms full of bad guys.

##9. [Everything Together](http://www.amazon.com/Sammy-Harkham-Everything-Collected-Picturebox/dp/0985159502)
From serious to seriously funny, Sammy Harkham is a master of the craft. The way he moves between genres appears to be effortless and never disappoints. Illustrating tales of teenage indiscretion, Harkham breathes new life into what can often be a cliched narrative. Never thought a comic strip about Napoleon trying to be a cartoonist would be funny but Harkham convinced me otherwise.

##8. [Study Group Comics](http://studygroupcomics.com/)
A mini-comic publisher that also puts their issues online to read for free, Study Group comics provides a wide array of some very talented work. Notables that you can read right now include Box Brown’s *[Softcore](http://studygroupcomics.com/main/category/title/soft-core/)*, Sam Alden’s *[Hunter](http://studygroupcomics.com/main/haunter-part-1-by-sam-alden/)*, Pete Toms’ *[Hiatus](http://studygroupcomics.com/main/on-hiatus-by-pete-toms/)*, Levon Jihanian's *[Danger Country](http://studygroupcomics.com/main/danger-country-by-levon-jihanian/)*, and Rich Tommasso's *[Dry County](http://studygroupcomics.com/main/dry-county-by-rich-tommaso/)*, with many more. Did I mention that it’s all good AND free?

##7. [Beta Testing the Apocalypse](http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/beta-testing-the-apocalypse-2.html?vmcchk=1)
The banality of modern life as experienced in various form: a celebrity cavemen, a young couple  living in an ever increasing gentrified neighborhood that become obsessed with a new condo development. Trying to explain it does it a huge disservice but looking back on it now, this book made so many important, poignant observations about the world we live in that you would be remiss to skip this one.

##6. [Pope Hats # 3](http://www.adhousebooks.com/comics/popehats3.html)
Okay, yes. This comic came in 2012 but it wasn’t until 2013 that I read it, and by virtue of it being so very really much good, I’m including it. Remember when you read On The Road as a teenager, how it filled you up completely with the warmth that only comes from a first chance meeting with a kindred soul? *Pope Hats* is that kind of book, but for adults in their late 20s, early 30s. Ethan Rilly’s two female protagonists, Victoria and Frances, wrestle with that space between being a child and being grown up in such a way that even in failure, they find success, and vice versa. 

##5. [Bioshock Infinite](http://www.bioshockinfinite.com/)
An excellent first person shooter with a vibrant setting, enough mystery to keep you guessing, and the boss fights that can be difficult but not too difficult. This was my introduction to the *Bioshock* world and I now see why so many people love this franchise. Except for that part with the guitar. Someone should have been fired for letting that part slip in.

##4. [Tao of Nao](http://www.naobrown.com/news/)
Mental illness has never been exquisitely captured as it has been depicted in the *Tao Of Nao*. Betweening battling her inner demons or escaping away into a manga-esque fantasy world, the protagonist Nao’s journeys are rendered beautifully by illustrator Glyn Dillon. At times this book was unsettling to read due to how well it captured the inner workings of Nao’s troubled mind but in the end, the journey was well worth it.

##3. [Nowhere Men](https://www.imagecomics.com/comics/series/nowhere-men)
When science is cooler than Rock n’ Roll, you send people to space and marvel at what happens when they change in ways man has never seen before. *Nowhere Men* covers the rise and fall of a four scientists using various magazine ads, inserts, and interviews that span their careers to build the world around. Add in an experiment on the edge of Earth’s orbit that goes frightening wrong and you have hit upon the recipe for a classic page-turner. This is the best *Fantastic Four* comic that Hickman wished he could have written. 

##2. [The Last Of Us](http://www.thelastofus.playstation.com/)
Joel is my dog. Thanks to Joel, Ellie, and their clicker wasting, “every man, woman, and child for themselves” survivalist killing spree, I have a rekindled love for Apocalyptic genre fiction. This game looks great and plays even better. The mechanics were perfect for a video game noob like me. While others deplored the wanton violence, I took solace in the fact that my youth spent reading *Punisher* and *Youngblood* comics properly prepared me to make the choices necessary to survive the end of times. 

##1. [East Of West](https://www.imagecomics.com/comics/series/east-of-west)
Jonathan Hickman has done a number of good things in 2013, but his and Nick Draggota’s *East Of West* has been the best thing I have read these past twelve months. An alternate history where the West is still wild and the Four Horseman walk across a North America unlike our own in search of Death himself. Black arts, robotic lazer-face wielding horses, political infighting and intrigue, and a prophecy that seems to signal an end even more nasty than Armageddon itself. From the setting to the diverse cast of characters that navigate it, Hickman and Draggota’s *East Of West* is doing a bang up job of delivering a high concept story that has yet to disappoint.
