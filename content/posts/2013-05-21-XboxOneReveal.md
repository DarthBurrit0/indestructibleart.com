<p><span class='slugline'>So here's what we know.</span> It's called the Xbox One. Which I think is a totally dumb name. Isn't this what everyone already calls the original Xbox? Dumb! But whatever it's called we now have a console race, and from what I can gather its going to be pretty close.</p>

<p>The Controller looks to be a good improvement ([polygon][polygon 7]). The Xbox controller was already my favorite from the consoles, and they've maintained the overall size and shape. Force feedback on the triggers seems like an interesting addition. I don't know what to make of the "Wi-Fi Direct Radio Stack", that was a bullet point in the video. I've never had an issue with connectivity from controller to system before. Maybe that means more to people in apartment buildings? No battery pack sticking out the back, which I guess would add to the ergonomics even though I never had an issue with the battery packs being in the way, and an improved D-Pad which was clearly the worst part of the 360 controller</p>

<a class="image-popup-vertical-fit" href="http://www.indestructibleart.com/images/forPosts/XboxOnePressKit/Hardware/Sensor/Tilt.png" title="Kinect Sensor">
  <img src='../images/forPosts/XboxOnePressKit/Hardware/Sensor/Tilt.png' class='articlesImgLeft'>
</a>
<p>Huge improvements have been made on the Kinect Sensor. If what we have in our living rooms now is ver.1 then what they're claiming will come with Xbox One has to be like ver.15. The cameras seem to be crazy more precise. Seeing way more points of articulation than the current version. There was even something about it being able to sense your heart rate for fitness apps. Wild.</p>

<p>People with Big Brother fears beware: a sensor will be included with every console, and the console will not function if the sensor is not connected. But this plays into what Microsoft wants us to want from console usability. Xbox is going to always be ready to go at your command. This isn't something that really speaks to me but I see the draw. Especially with all the non-game media they have going on. Speaking commands to change channels or switch to some other dashboard view seems interesting.</p>

<p>What I want to know about is Kinect + Controller support in games. There was a quick mention during the event about the two working together in games. This is what Kinect should have been from the start. I never understood Microsoft's stance on Kinect being the only input for Kinect games. Glad to see that they've seen the light.</p>

<p>The Console itself is huge. Like early VCR huge. Now this could just be some weird perspective on the images that are out, but holy cow it's big. Does this mean the PS4 is going to be similarly sized? Am I going to need to invest in a new entertainment center, maybe with reinforced legs or something?</p>

<p>We get Bluray this time, which they had to do if they want this to be people's entertainment system. Discs are on the way out, but we're just not there yet. This [Wired][wired 1] article gives you a good look at the back of the system. Hdmi in and out, Optical Audio, 3 USB 3.0 ports, Kinect plug in, IR out, and Ethernet. Wireless is built in which isnt surprising and USB 3 makes me thing external drives, but what catches my attention most is the Hdmi In and IR Out. This gives me nightmares about how much junk it was to control a cable box from my TiVo years ago. IR blasters are the pits. hopefully they've figured out something here that make it run smoothly. If They want it to play like the press event demo there has to be something more to it. I mean there isn't a hole for cablecards so who knows.<p>
<p>There wasn't a whole lot of time spent on the specs of the system itself like we got from Sony earlier this year. An 8 Core CPU/GPU combo, 8 gigs of RAM, 500gb Hard Drive. So we're looking at a systems that stacks up pretty evenly to PS4. Hopefully this means multi release games will preform pretty similar, making the choice between which version to play based on graphics or performance a non issue. Services will drive people buying decisions. There seems to be parity in other places as well. Instant On ([Polygon][polygon 5]), play as you download/install and resume features ([Polygon][polygon 3]), and as much of a bummer that it is a lack of backward compatibility ([Polygon][polygon 9]). It also seems that the "Always Online DRM" rumors were false ([Polygon][polygon 8]).</p>

<p>So what about those extra services. It's clear from this event that Microsoft has a lot of focus on extra entertainment services. TV, Movies, Music, and Web get front row exposure. This isn't to say that they're ignoring games to further these things. They just made this the focus of this event. I bet that come E3 we'll see the second half of what the Xbox One has to offer. This might all sound fanboy-ish but I really do think this is a multi tiered reveal. Which to is to say I'm not worried yet that we didn't see a whole lot of game coverage.</p>
<p>One of the stories that hit just after the Press Event was that all Xbox One game discs will be tied to the first Xbox Live account that installs the game, and that there will be a "Pre-Owned Fee" charged to whoever else wants to install from that disc ([Polygon][polygon 1]). This is a confusing topic and I'm sure this story is going to get wildly out of control in the news. As I understand it now, once a game is installed to the system you no longer need to have the game in the drive for it to play as you do now. So what other way will there be to keep people from just installing a game and then passing it off to someone else? Seems like a no-brainer to me that this system would be put into place. The question is how is the "Pre-Owned Fee" going to be priced, and how will that price change with the age of the game. [Kotaku][kotaku 1] is running a story that you'll be able to trade and sell your games online, not sure what that means for stores like Gamestop. The main question brought up with that article is what if you bring you game to a friends house to play. Do you need to purchase the game again to play there, as the article seems to suggest? How about just signing into your live account of a friend's machine? This is already how it works with XBLA content, so I'm not seeing the issue.</p>

<p>So yea we didn't see a whole lot of game coverage, and I am a little disapointed in the lack of tech talk, but overall it was pretty good. New Consoles! And with E3 just weeks away there will be so much more information out really soon. Now that the Xbox One "Exists" all kinds of game studios will announcing what they been working on.</p>
<p class='sluglineCenter'>IT'S NEW CONSOLE TIME PEOPLE. GET PSYCHED!</p>
