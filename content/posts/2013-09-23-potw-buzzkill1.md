    Browsing through my local comic shop, "Buzzkill" issue one caught my eye with the bold quote on the cover "God, I wish I'd thought about this - Mark Waid", so I took a gamble with a creative time I didn't know anything about, and it paid off. Buzzkill gives you everything you could want in a first issue: unique characters, solid pacing, an intriguing concept, and fantastic art.  
<br>
    Buzzkill has a unique premise: A superhero who gets his powers from drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. The basis of this story could of been played up for laughs, but writers Donny Cates and Mark Reznicek have decided wisely to give us a story that takes the subject matter more seriously. We are introduced to our hero "Reuben" when he attends an AA meeting to discuss his alcoholism. Using the meeting as a way to give us the character's back story keeps the story progressing instead of bogging down the reader with typical origin stories that tend to plague first issues. This issue does a fantastic job setting up the narrative and potential conflict for the rest of the series, and I'm hooked.

    Mark my words, artist Geoff Shaw is going to be a huge star. His bold line work mixed with some rough/sketchy pencils bring the story to life reminding me of the brilliance of Sean Murphy and Raphael Albuquerque. The guy can draw a room full of characters talking to each other for a number of panels and it never comes off as stale or static, he then ups the ante with some visceral action when the story calls for it.  
<br>
    Dark Horse has been putting out a lot of great series this year, from Francesco Francavilla's "Black Beetle" to "Dream Thief", but Buzzkill could be the sleeper hit of 2013, and if Mark Waid likes it, you should too.
