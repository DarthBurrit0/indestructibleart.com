<p class='slugline'>Microsoft has finally gotten around to updating us on some of the concerns that followed the reveal last month. Thanks Microsoft!</p>
<br>
Here's a quick rundown of some of the key points to note. (Quotes from: [xbox][xbox1])

###On "Always On" Networking: ([source][xbox2])
>* For an optimal experience, we recommend a broadband connection of 1.5Mbps. (For reference, the average global internet connection speed as measured recently by Akamai was 2.9 Mbps).  In areas where an Ethernet connection is not available, you can connect using mobile broadband.

>* While a persistent connection is not required, Xbox One is designed to verify if system, application or game updates are needed and to see if you have acquired new games, or resold, traded in, or given your game to a friend. Games that are designed to take advantage of the cloud may require a connection.

>* With Xbox One you can game offline for up to 24 hours on your primary console, or one hour if you are logged on to a separate console accessing your library. Offline gaming is not possible after these prescribed times until you re-establish a connection, but you can still watch live TV and enjoy Blu-ray and DVD movies.

Assuming that every XONE user is going to have a Broadband connection seems a bit unrealistic, and stating that users without can just use mobile broadband is even more so. I wonder how many games we going to see that follow this assumption. Or does is even matter? Games that require Broadband speeds will most likely be online play, and people withour wont play those games anyway? Fingers crossed that the world learned from all that SimCity madness I guess.
  
I have to believe that the 24 hour check-in time on your home console is going to change based on the outcry on the internet right now. But I don't see this all as that bad. It's all trade offs right? XONE won't need the disc in the tray to play a game. That is awesome! Not to mention a key feature if MS wants this to be a entertainment hub. I very much like the idea of being able to jumps from game to game based on which friends I have playing what. The only way that all works is for the system to check if you have the license to play that game. This is the way of the future guys. It's all going this way. PCs have been doing it for years and not one cared, and now consoles are catching up.
  
A valid concern is that in X amount of years when the XONE is being phased out and the servers are going to come down what will happen to the games. When they're gone and XONE cant connect every 24 hours are all my games dead? Valve has come out saying that if the Steam servers were to come down they would push the magic button unlocking everything you had, allowing you to keep playing without authentication. Can we expect the same from MS? I'm sure most would say not. It is a shame that we are past a time when we could keep these systems around well past their prime and plug them in for kicks. 

###On "Used Games" or Game Licensing: ([source][xbox3])
>* **Buy the way you want—disc or digital—on the same day:** You’ll be able to buy disc-based games at traditional retailers or online through Xbox Live, on day of release. Discs will continue to be a great way to install your games quickly.

>* **Access your entire games library from any Xbox One—no discs required:** After signing in and installing, you can play any of your games from any Xbox One because a digital copy of your game is stored on your console and in the cloud.  So, for example, while you are logged in at your friend’s house, you can play your games.

>* **Share access to your games with everyone inside your home:** Your friends and family, your guests and acquaintances get unlimited access to all of your games.  Anyone can play your games on your console--regardless of whether you are logged in or their relationship to you.

>* **Give your family access to your entire games library anytime, anywhere:** Xbox One will enable new forms of access for families. Up to ten members of your family can log in and play from your shared games library on any Xbox One. Just like today, a family member can play your copy of Forza Motorsport at a friend’s house. Only now, they will see not just Forza, but all of your shared games.  You can always play your games, and any one of your family members can be playing from your shared library at a given time.

>* **Trade-in and resell your disc-based games:** Today, some gamers choose to sell their old disc-based games back for cash and credit. We designed Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers.  Microsoft does not charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games.

>* **Give your games to friends:** Xbox One is designed so game publishers can enable you to give your disc-based games to your friends. There are no fees charged as part of these transfers. There are two requirements: you can only give them to people who have been on your friends list for at least 30 days and each game can only be given once.

>* In our role as a game publisher, Microsoft Studios will enable you to give your games to friends or trade in your Xbox One games at participating retailers. Third party publishers may opt in or out of supporting game resale and may set up business terms or transfer fees with retailers.  Microsoft does not receive any compensation as part of this. In addition, third party publishers can enable you to give games to friends. Loaning or renting games won’t be available at launch, but we are exploring the possibilities with our partners.

>* As we move into this new generation of games and entertainment, from time to time, Microsoft may change its policies, terms, products and services to reflect modifications and improvements to our services, feedback from customers and our business partners or changes in our business priorities and business models or for other reasons.  We may also cease to offer certain services or products for similar reasons.

>* In the months ahead, we will continue to listen to your feedback as we meet with our partners in the ecosystem to bring additional detail about our policies.

So MS is going to be leaving it up to publishers to decide how Used Games and Sharing is handled. *Great.* This is going to be a disaster. What publisher is going to want to allow used games sales? Probably none. What publisher is going to be the first to take this stance? Who knows. For me personally, as I feel the general trend is going to be, I'm probably not going to be buying a whole lot of games on discs. While that doesn't excuse anyone from denying you the right to sell off used games, I wonder how long people are actually going to care about all this. Yea it makes for great negative MS or Next Gen talk, but again PC games are the same way. People still love PC gaming. What is it that excuses Steam or GOG from the flames of the used games war? Crazy sales? If something is super cheap then I guess people don't care to sell it back.
  
The sharing with friends spot could get interesting. Seems to me that it would be smart for Pubs to allow something like 1 or 2 day sharing windows. It would basically be extended game demos, getting more people to buy to either finish a game or to play with friends after they get that taste. Amazon introduced this model a while back with Kindle books. They let Pubs decided which book were allowed to be shared between accounts. From my understanding there are almost no books that the feature works on. Shame. 

###On Privacy with the New Kinect ([source][xbox4])
>* **You are in control of what Kinect can see and hear:** By design, you will determine how responsive and personalized your Xbox One is to you and your family during setup. The system will navigate you through key privacy options, like automatic or manual sign in, privacy settings, and clear notifications about how data is used. When Xbox One is on and you’re simply having a conversation in your living room, your conversation is not being recorded or uploaded. 

>* **You are in control of when Kinect sensing is On, Off or Paused:** If you don’t want the Kinect sensor on while playing games or enjoying your entertainment, you can pause Kinect. To turn off your Xbox One, just say “Xbox Off.” When the system is off, it’s only listening for the single voice command -- “Xbox On,” and you can even turn that feature off too. Some apps and games may require Kinect functionality to operate, so you’ll need to turn it back on for these experiences.

>* **You are in control of your personal data:** You can play games or enjoy applications that use data, such as videos, photos, facial expressions, heart rate and more, but this data will not leave your Xbox One without your explicit permission. Here are a few examples of potential future scenarios:
>    * A fitness game could measure heart rate data to provide you with improved feedback on your workout, allow you to track your progress, or even measure calories burned.
>    * A card game could allow you to bluff your virtual opponent using your facial expressions.

>* **You can use other inputs to control your games, TV and entertainment experiences:** While it’s faster to find what you’re looking for using your voice and gesture commands with Kinect, you can use a controller, your remote controls or your smart devices instead. And you can use all of these devices when Kinect is paused.

I hope this puts some people at ease. You can turn off pretty much all of the Kinect functions. No more fear of it watching you sleep. Right?
  
This isn't ["Antitrust"][movie]. MS isn't watching you to steal your secret codez.
  
Or are they???...
