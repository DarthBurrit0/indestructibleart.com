<p>I am very confused about what this game has turned into. Last year I could have sworn it was going to be another game just like Heavy Rain, that had a great premise but just couldn't hold my attention all the way through. It looks Like Quantic Dream has figured out the mix of drama, action, and mystery to really bring the movie like visual narrative to life in what I've seen of Beyond: Two Souls.</p>
<p>The uncanny valley stuff still weirds me out a bit.</p>
