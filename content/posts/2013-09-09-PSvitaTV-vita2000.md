<img src='/images/forPosts/psvita-tv-01.png' class='articlesImgCenter'> Games coverage being what it is these days, it's pretty rare to get one past the ol'internet. However, as we get ready to rush headlong into new console season Sony appears to be pulling out all of the stops. On Monday Sony announced its plans to release two new pieces of hardware in the upcoming months. The first is a new slimmer remodel of the PS Vita. The second and slightly more unexpected announcement unveiled Sony's new PlayStation Vita TV.

<p>Take a look at the new PS Vita.</p>

<p>The new thinner model, referred to as the PHC-2000, is touted to be 15% lighter, 20% thinner, and packed with an extra hour of battery life. The screen will remain the same size however the original Vita's OLED screen will be replaced with an LCD screen in the newer model. Although there has been no date mentioned yet for a US release the new Vita remodel is scheduled for launch October 10th in Japan at 19,929 yen or about $200. The new model will also be available in six different colors.

<p>Just like many other set top boxes, this slender rectangular box seeks to bring video and network streaming services like Hulu right to the big screen in your home. However, the super awesome part about the Vita TV, as it's name implies, the device will allow you to play Vita games on your television through the use of a Vita card slot. Vita TV has 1gb of internal memory but it also has a slot for external memory as well. Assuming the memory card format is the same as the Vita's, accessing your digital library seems like a no-brainer.</p>

<p>Video output appears to be limited to 430p, 720p, and 1080i which is interesting considering an eventual feature of the Vita TV will allow players to stream PS4 games to the device from another room using Remote Play. This new addition to the Sony family is set to launch Nov 14th in Japan for 9,954 yen (about $100 US). A slightly more expensive version bundled with a PS3 controller and an 8gb memory card will be sold as well at 14,994 yen (roughly $150 US). You can read about the specs in the <a href="http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/release/pdf/130909c_e.pdf">official press release.</a></p>

<p>This feels like the first time I have been surprised in a while by a major announcement. Sure it seems like box top sets and small console are popping up all the time but some of what Vita TV is offering seems promising. I can't really see it being popular among one TV households but the idea of streaming games from a main entertainment room that's being occupied to another TV in the house is a solid solution to a problem game enthusiasts have had since the early days of consoles. It's one of the favored features of the WiiU Pad and even Microsoft has often been rumored to be developing a stripped down set top box that would allow a 360 or an Xbox One to have a similar remote play feature.</p>
