Did the lead up to holiday times keep you from reading about you favorite comics or video games? Us too. Don't fret though! We have a nice little recap of the goings on from the week of Dec 15th to 21st. Check it out.

###Video Games:###
* **PAX Diversity Lounges** - [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/pax-will-now-have-diversity-lounges-penny-arcade-say-1485455044)
> As an attempt at fixing discriminatory or hateful behavior at their conventions the Penny Arcade people plan to set up Diversity Lounges as a “Safe Place” for people to go in the convention. Is this a step in the right direction, or another sign that they just don’t get it?

* **Polygon Story on Max Temkin** - [Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/20/5219806/max-temkin-against-humanity)
> Pretty rad interview with Max Temkin on just what makes him and CAH such an amazing force on the Internet.

* **Cards Against Humanity’s Holiday Bullshit paid over $100k public schools** - [CAH](http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/donorschoose/)
> CAH did a really awesome thing. Over $100k (which I believe is all the profits) from thier Holiday Bullshit sale went to public schools. The site has some real funny infographics. (Better when viewed on a desktop computer)

* **Holiday Bullshit from Cards Against Humanity** - [HolidayBullshit](http://www.holidaybullshit.com/)
> As the holiday pack this year CAH mailed people one thing for each of the 12 days of Xmas. Pretty awesome. Site has some funny videos they made for each days themes.

* **Skullgirls Drama** - [LabZero](http://labzerogames.com/skullgirls-encore-and-you/)
> With all the drama surrounding Skullgirls being removed from XBLA and PSN, Lab Zero give a nice clean look at what users can expect from the upcoming switch to Skullgirls Encore.

* **DRM Strikes Down a Killer Instinct Tournament** - [Kotaku](http://kotaku.com/xbox-one-drm-check-poses-problem-for-killer-instinct-at-1485708399?utm_campaign=Socialflow_Kotaku_Facebook&utm_source=Kotaku_Facebook&utm_medium=Socialflow)
> In the first of what I'm sure will be many "See I Told Ya" moments for XboxOne's DRM policies, a Killer Instinct Tournament was put on hold while the XboxOne was trying to reestablish an interent connection to check the purchase right to the game. Definitly raises the question to the viability of Killer Instinct in Tournaments, but I guess time and more attempts will tell. It should be noted that XboxOne waited until after the current match was over before doing its online check, as to not boot the players mid round.

* **UK Vita sales increase with PS4 launch** - [The Escapist](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/130741-Sony-PS4s-Launch-Increases-Vita-Sales)
> It should come as no surprise that Vita sales have increased since the launch of the PS4. Who knew that actual working connectivity between the two systems would increase its desirability. The Vita is a rad system people, and people who have a PS4 are actively missing out if the don't have one.

* **WiiU GamePad gets better Official battery** - [Nintendo](https://store.nintendo.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?productId=211708&catalogId=10001&storeId=10001&categoryId=69716&krypto=GrjJmjV7%2Fh%2BLquzlLeEgC0pM7E9p4HRUPrBBk5noDOUhysvG4h%2BRIMfOJ2hjwRRRKRVvdQqs1rg%3D&ddkey=https:SetCurrencyPreference)
> One of the main gripe I've heard about the WiiU is the battery life on the Gamepad. Good on the Big N for putting out a fairly inexpensive upgrade.

* **Steam Box has a 1TB of memory 16gb RAM** - [Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/19/steam-machine-teardown-reveals-1tb-hybrid-drive-16gb-ram/)
> We are on the verge of knowing if the Steam Box really is the Console disruptor that some think it can be. These are some pretty beefy stats, now the big question is the retail cost.

* **Nintendo Direct** - [Nintendo](http://www.nintendo.com/nintendo-direct/archive/12-18-2013)
> Nintendo's final Nintendo Direct of the year, and it had some interesting stuff. You should watch the whole thing, but here are a few of the highlights if you're pressed for time.
    * **Hyrule Warriors**[YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOq4IiuRMWk)
    * **Rosalina added to Smash Bros U** [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOq4IiuRMWk)

    * **Dr. Luigi** - [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cu9bfHyb9k)

* **TuneCore explains copyright claims with YouTube ContentID** - [JoyStiq](http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/21/tunecore-explains-music-based-youtube-claims/)
> As one of the sources of the YouTube ContentID claims recently in the news TuneCore gives a quick recap of their motives to filing these claims.
