<img src='/images/forPosts/thelastofus-title.png' class='articlesImgCenter'> If you somehow managed to miss Naughty Dog's The Last of Us, stop what you are doing and go check out that game. In addition to that, if you haven't played it yet stop reading now. I want to address some of the critical story moments in the game and this is one you certainly don't want to ruin for yourself. On the other hand, if you don't care about spoilers then maybe some of the things I experienced will encourage you to check it out.

<p>I admit, The Last of Us carries a heavy arsenal of cliches that are more than enough to make you cringe, but it doesn't take long for all of the other merits of the game to start shining through. When they do, they shine brightly enough to make you forget you're playing a game. You actually begin to start experiencing something that is slightly terrifying...but by then it's too late, you can't pull yourself away. This is one of the best interactions a player can ask for from a game.</p>

<p>It's probably sentiments similar to my own that caused so much drama over Philip Kollar's The Last of Us review posted over at [Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/game/the-last-of-us/3040).</p>

<p>Surely outliers happen but perfect scores from Edge Magazine, EuroGamer, Joystiq, IGN, Destructoid, and Giant Bomb didn't necessarily make it easy for a lot of people to swallow  Kollar's review on Polygon which posted with a comparatively glaring score of 7.5 out of 10. For those not aware, in terms of traditional game reviews that's not great...maybe not even good. Especially for a big budget game developed by a studio with more than a decent amount of prestige.</p>

<p>To Polygon's credit there is a page that describes how games are reviewed and scored right on the site. After reading that page it's easy to see that Kollar's review might actually read like a 7.5 according to the site's official [review philosophy](http://www.polygon.com/pages/about-reviews). Polygon isn't the only website to provide this type of information out in the open and it certainly isn't the only site to use the entirety of a 20 point scale. Unfortunately years of academic conditioning and traditional reviews have trained us to see a 7.5 as mediocre at best. In the end it doesn't matter how Polygon qualifies their scores because public perception already dictates the value of those ten little numbers. Anything below an 8.0 just isn't good for your health.</p>

<p>Why should anybody care what Kollar thinks anyway? The game clearly sold well and won enough reviewers over to be deemed a 'critical success' right? Shouldn't that be enough?</p>
</div>

<div class='articleSection'>
<p>Maybe the reason Polygon's 7.5 caused such a commotion is because it forced people to ask a lot of questions. I don't mean the crazy kind where message boards get flamed with allegations of reviews being payed for by publishers or insinuations that a reviewer is biased against a particular platform so said reviewer obviously has something to gain by causing a game's Metacritic score to drop...</p>

<p>The questions I am talking about are more of an internal struggle and probably lead to reactive behavior like flaming message boards or blindly defending something.</p>

<p>An outlying score, positive or negative, causes us to question or own tastes and our own metrics of value. Part of growing up is being able to recognize the things you like and don't like without being told by someone else. A bigger part of that is being at peace with allowing someone else to have a different opinion and maybe even trying to see things from a different perspective. I was excited to read Kollar's review because I like being challenged.</p>

<img src='/images/forPosts/thelastofus-tess-joel.png' class='articlesImgCenter'>

<p>Trying to strip away all the anticipation and hype for a game, a movie, or a comic is a hard thing to do. Even more difficult, is trying to; understand, articulate, and argue what makes something awesome. However, I try to practice all the time. I want to be better at identifying my biasses and seeing the core elements of something that I like. "Why is a game good?" is an increasingly more important question than, "Is a game good?"</p>
</div>

<div class='articleSection'>
<p>Admittedly I agree with a lot of the criticisms written in Kollar's review. Does The Last of Us deserve more than a 7.5? That's not really important to me. What's important is that Kollar has some valid claims in his review and instead of writing them off we should probably explore them. Ultimately it's the constructive and insightful criticism that Naughty Dog will use to make their next game better.</p>

<img src='/images/forPosts/thelastofus-headshot.png' class='articlesImgRight'>

<p>Before you upgrade, shooting in The Last of Us can feel pretty clunky. Performance is important in a game with stealth and survival elements so I can see why Kollar would be upset about the shooting feeling a little shaky. If you've got 4 clickers to kill silently and only 2 arrows to do it - you better make those arrows count or you're going to get mobbed. On the upside, erratic movement patterns of infected enemies really make it a risk to decide to shoot them. A miss could mean life, death, or the inventible ammo consuming blood bath. I think that type of risk adds a lot of positive weight to the gameplay.</p>

<p>Moving a ladder around or trying to activate a 'partner assist' certainly felt off sometimes. I occasionally found myself standing directly under or over a friendly AI hammering the triangle button trying to initiate some type of assist. Eventually I would have to readjust my position because I was probably too close for the event to trigger or maybe the camera was pointed slightly in the wrong direction. This is especially stressful when trying to evacuate an area that's still crawling with ugly flesh eating fungus monsters.</p>

<img src='/images/forPosts/thelastofus-assist.png' class='articlesImgLeft'>

<p>Lastly, at one point a friendly AI opened fire after I slightly alerted a Clicker. Bill's shotgun blast brought a hail of death and a handful of infected upon me but it only happened the one time.</p>
<p>As you can see I agree with Kollar about some of the mechanics in The Last of Us, but eventually I put in enough time to get used to the quirks. Which doesn't seem that much different from any other game to me. I had a similar experience with Dishonored and even MGS2 when I revisited it earlier this year. Maybe it was harder to get use to the Last of Us because after playing hours and hours of Uncharted I had quite a bit of muscle memory to remaster.  </p>
</div>

<div class='articleSection'>
<p>Where I actually disagree with Kollar is when he get's down to the bottom of his reason for not liking the game, "I want games to strive for more than pure entertainment value, and Naughty Dog is trying. But I couldn't find any deeper meaning in the horrible events in The Last of Us."</p>

<p>He's right, the game has a very somber tone. Before the Winter chapter I had a hard time playing the game in long sessions at my usual break neck pace. However, where Kollar didn't find meaning in some of the games events I found that the events during the winter chapter and slightly after affected me so heavily that I had to take a break from The Last of Us for an entire day. A game has never made me feel that way. Maybe part of it is because I am not a big fan of violence and gore, often feeling that it's needless or it doesn't facilitate a story.</p>

<p>It wasn't the brutality of the lodge scene or Joel' s interrogation that hit me so hard. It was after.</p>

<img src='/images/forPosts/thelastofus-ellie-staring.png' class='articlesImgCenter'>

<p>Seeing how the violent world of The Last of Us finally managed to break Ellie down hit me on a personal level. I have never had to fight for my own survival before but I have certainly experienced trauma in which I knew I would never perceive things the same way again. Sometimes that traumatic experience isn't just one event but the compilation of a lot of hardships building up over a long period of time.</p>
</div>

<div class='articleSection'>
<p>In most games, save Spec Ops the Line, violent events you dish out are usually not addressed. Master Chief is constantly working at xeno-genocide, in Assassins Creed revenge is a license to stab everyone in the neck, and in BioShock Infinite everyone is crazy or racist so it's alright to electrocute them and then tear there face apart with a magnetic hook. You never have to struggle with the justification of those protagonists actions.</p>

<p>After being forced to bite, stab, and hack her way to survival Ellie changes. She was broken and I was broken with her. I wasn't sure how to process the events I had experienced. Joel tried, and I had tried, so hard to get there and be there for her but the reality was she was on her own. I couldn't help but wonder if this is how parents feel sometimes. Only Ellie had the power to make things better by coping and dealing with the experience in her own way. Joel's attempts to talk and comfort her reminded me of my own parents who were about as successful at breaking down the walls.</p>

<p>Ellie couldn't think or even focus in the present and it seemed all too familiar. I knew as she looked on or stared at the ground she was stuck in that terrible place. I worried its affects were permanent. After all, most traumatic events we experience, stay with us our entire lives.</p>

<img src='/images/forPosts/thelastofus-ellie-deer.png' class='articlesImgCenter'>

<p>When she stared at the buck mural on the freeway, I imagined how accomplished she must have felt when she tracked and hunted a buck all by herself just that winter. Unfortunately, that moment was taken from her and ruined by a sick fuck who pretended to be her friend but ultimately wanted to kill and eat her. Instead of thinking about how accomplished and essential to Joel's survival she had become, that winter would always be a dark place for her. The moment she lost herself to the hardships of her reality.</p>

<p>Maybe that's why Joel was trying to stay so detached from Ellie in the beginning of the game. He wasn't protecting himself from getting hurt as much as he was trying to protect Ellie from the hostile place that the world had become.</p>
</div>

<div class='articleSection'>
<p>After seeing how hard Ellie fought to survive through the course of winter it didn't seem to make sense at the end of the game that she would willingly lie down and let it all end, even if lying down meant finding a cure for all of humanity. I felt like Ellie and Joel fought for more than that. They deserved more than that.</p>

<p>It's why Ellie 'swallows' the lie. She knows that Joel went through hell too and that he needs her just as much as she needed him. They overcame their individual traumas together though they never really spoke about them. Ellie's loss of her best friend who is actually now replaced by Joel, and Joel's loss of his daughter who is now replaced by Ellie.</p>

<img src='/images/forPosts/thelastofus-joel-comforting.png' class='articlesImgRight'>

<p>Cementing that idea is the imagery of Joel carrying Ellie out of the lab the same way he tried to carry his daughter to safety in the games introduction. Marlene a lone soldier with a gun tells them to stop. Joel's wiser this time, he knows what's at risk, so he pulls the trigger even after Marlene puts her gun down. After losing everything in Texas he's not about to take any chances. It's a theme we see through out the game. More than a theme, it's the affect of Joel's loss that causes him to act the way he does.</p>

<p>You could make the argument that Joel didn't need to kill Marlene or even the doctor in the lab. Other than for shock value, the hyper violence in these scenes seems pointless. These people were defenseless compared to Joel and it's definitely not the first time we see him take a life when he already has more than the upper hand. I don't entirely disagree but the games writing is committed to its characters. Joel murders these people because of his past experiences. The opening scene of the The Last of Us shows us nobody is to be trusted and if you hesitate you could loose everything. Just like Joel did in Texas.</p>
</div>

<div class='articleSection'>
<p>As players, we don't necessarily agree with Joel's decisions or his brutality but ultimately it allows him to get Ellie across the country. It's what kept him alive over the years as well as his brother. However. his behavior shows that he has been severely broken by the world he lives in. Not entirely unlike Ellie after her close encounter with death in the lodge.</p>

<img src='/images/forPosts/thelastofus-joel-monster.png' class='articlesImgCenter'>

<p>Philip Kollar's opening sentence in his review is, "The Last of Us made me feel sick to my stomach." The game definitely made me feel sick to my stomach too. But as I think about it the feeling wasn't because of the violence, the gore, or the gross mutated zombie monsters. It was because of the stakes. The thought of loosing a friend, a daughter, a father, or a companion who values your safety enough to risk their own life for you. Then the thought of being completely helpless when those people need you the most. Or maybe even just considering what I would be willing to do to protect the people in my life that I care about. Furthermore, the ending doesn't leave us with any easy answers.</p>

<p>Was it selfish of Joel to whisk Ellie away from the lab or was he trying to protect her from people that betrayed her trust? Wasn't Marlene a friend? Did the Fireflies even tell Ellie she wasn't going to survive the operation? How would Ellie feel if she knew Joel murdered Marlene in cold blood? We don't really get a chance to see what Ellie wants. When she tells her story of how she got bit it seems like Ellie wanted to die the entire time. However when she 'buys' Joel's lie it's more like she understands he's trying to protect her from the truth. A truth that she has already experienced first hand. Sometimes the world is a terrible place.</p>

<p>If the unsettling feeling of the games narrative is why Kollar felt sick to his stomach and that's why he gave The Last of Us a 7.5 I think Naughty Dog should be proud they were able evoke that kind of response with a video game. I don't think it's easy to make your protagonist a monster and still get people to care about him. Perhaps even facilitating that uneasy feeling by having Ellie care about Joel and depend on him when we know he's actually gone a little too far off the deep end.</p>
</div>

<div class='articleSection'>
<p>There's no knight in shining armor in the Last of Us. Only cause and effect. What The Last of Us accomplishes that other games fail at is creating long lasting effects that form the characters - for better or for worse.</p>

<img src='/images/forPosts/thelastofus-lodgefire.png' class='articlesImgCenter'>

<p>In the face of all the cliches and video game nonsense Naughty Dog was able to make me care about Ellie and Joel. I was almost afraid to see what their fates had in store for them but I was compelled to see them through their journey. As a critique on Kollar's review I don't think he went far enough in explaining his final sentiment,"Survival in the post-apocalypse requires compromise, but The Last of Us has given up something vital."</p>

<p>I feel like Kollar is arguing that the quality of the games mechanics and gameplay don't really match the quality of the games fictional world or story arcs. It's not like Naughty Dog traded "tired scenario design" for "emotional high points." They obviously did everything in their power to make the best game they could. I guess that's where I am confused. I have played a few stealth games this past year and I think among them, The Last of Us probably did the best job of making me feel like my actions were weighted and my resources limited.</p>

<p>Sure it's still frustrating when you get caught or go left when you should have gone right, but how do you fix something that plagues a genre? That might not be a question a game reviewer is responsible for answering, but I think it's a helpful discussion to have for all parties involved. Who is better to ask than someone who gets paid to play games for a living? Or at the very least, let's break down the unpleasant parts and figure out exactly what the problems are. An ambiguous analogue about tired design or AAA development doesn't really help anybody. However, explaining exactly what feels tired or broken helps make games better for everyone.</p>

<p>Personally I never really depend on a review to determine a games worth. That's something I know I need to figure out on my own. You can certainly determine the flavor of a game from a review and make a purchasing decision based on that flavor...but in terms of assigning some kind of magical value that validates your taste, I think your on your own.</p>

<p>A review is going to be painted with the biased brush of the author and no matter how severe or subtle those biases are, a review is an opinion. Sometimes those opinions are well informed and maybe other times not so much. At the very least a good review will just let you know wether or not your tastes line up with the reviewer's. It's a good thing to know as it will help improve the basis for your purchasing decision but it doesn't necessarily make someone else's criticisms of a thing you like less valid. If a game you like has flaws accept them, embrace them even, or better yet make a compelling argument for why those flaws inconsequential compared to the merits.</p>

<p>Kollar has his 7.5 score for the Last of Us. That's not the score I would have given it, but I respect his opinion and would love to have a conversation about how he arrived at his final verdict. More importantly, I think the most valuable thing to take away from Kollar's review is that it's important to test and challenge the metrics we use to determine value. Otherwise how do we know what elements of the medium need to improve?</p>

<p>Maybe a more interesting conversation is a broader discussion about what Kollar expects from games going forward, because as he mentioned in his review, some of those expectations fell flat during The Last of Us.</p>

<p>In any case, before you get all riled up about the next review score that doesn't sit well with you, try to find another reason the score bothers you instead of simply pointing at Metacritic. Talking about tangible criticisms,   narrative discourse, and expectations of the medium on a public forum actually helps game developers make their video games better...and when that happens, everybody wins.</p>
