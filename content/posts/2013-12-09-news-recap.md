Hi, and welcome to the first post of IA’s weekly news round up. Sometimes trying to keep your thumb on the pulse of all things comics and games can be a bit daunting and it’s easy to feel like you missed something. Thats why we are putting together this weekly recap. It’s a list of all our favorite stories over the past week. Think of the round up as a curated RSS feed with optional commentary. Hopefully it’s a good way to quickly check and see if you missed any cool stories from the past week.

So without further delay here is your Weekly Recap for Dec 1st - 7th

###Video Games:###
* **Every VGX trailer** -  [Venture Beat](http://venturebeat.com/2013/12/07/watch-every-trailer-from-spikes-vgx-award-show-right-here/)  
> What is a VGX? I don’t think anyone really knows the answer to that question but the short answer is: the thing that was once called the Spike TV Video Game Awards or VGAs is now called the Spike TV Video Game...Xperience...neXt generation….Xcite… err, thing that is usually a trainwreck but we show you a ton of cool trailers for games coming out neXt year?....um  you know, VGX.

* **Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition** - [JoyStiq](http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/07/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-confirmed-for-xbox-one-ps4/)
> One thing that particularly caught my eye during the VGX stream on Saturday was the announcement of Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition which is coming out for the new generation of consoles. The developers over at Crystal Dynamics feel the power of the Xbox One and the PS4 will allow them to make a better version of the Tomb Raider game that was released earlier this year. It’s a cool notion unless you feel salty about shelling out full price for that other crumbier version. Look at the bright side, without you the Definitive Edition couldn’t have existed. I expect we will see more of this happening with a multitude of games in the future. Kind of like Game of The Year editions or Directors cuts all over again, huh?. I’m on board.

* **Ground Zeros is going to be really short and MGSV won’t be out for a while** - [Side Mission](http://www.gametrailers.com/side-mission/66798/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain-wont-be-coming-out-for-a-long-while?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter)
> MGS fans may have been slightly disappointed last week when Kojima openly compared the length of Ground Zeros to the first 15 minutes of a film. I hope they don’t plan on charging full price for it, or if they are I hope they give us a reason to want to pay it.

* **Riot Games restricts Pro Leaguers from streaming other games in their free time** - [On Gamers](http://www.ongamers.com/articles/riot-season-4-lcs-contracts-stipulate-players-cannot-stream-dota-2-blizzard-games/1100-261/)
> Professional athletes signing non compete acts is long observed practice. I guess it’s just weird when you start applying that stuff to video games. Apparently Professional League of Legends players are no longer aloud to stream games of Fat Princess in their spare time.

* **Riot overturns their decision to ban pro players from extra curricular streaming** - [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1sa59j/update_on_the_lcs_streaming_policy/)
> The people have spoken, and it appears they really don’t care much for being told what they can do with their free time. In retrospect it makes a lot of sense that a game company would want to keep its players from promoting a competing company’s games but that should shouldn’t take precedence over the promotion of games as a whole...or you know...someones free time.

* **Three rad Kickstarter games** - [Paradise Lost: First Contact](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1183462809/paradise-lost-first-contact?ref=live), [Dino Run 2](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pixeljam/dino-run-2) and [Scale](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1188957169/scale)
> Every other month or so, a few Kickstarter project’s pop up that are worth taking a look at. Unfortunately, sometimes by the time you learn about them they are already funded or inevitably doomed. This month was no exception. Go check out Dino Run 2, a game where you play as dinosaurs outrunning extinction, and Paradise Lost, a game in which you play as a plant like tentacle monster with some cool abilities for outsmarting humans. The third game is called Scale and has a mechanic which seemingly allows you to shrink and grow things to solve puzzles. If that’s not enough it would seem the games protagonist is voiced by Ashly Burch.

* **The Burch Family visits Saints Row IV** - [HAWP](http://www.heyash.com/we-are-a-saints-row-iv-dlc/)
> It warms my heart to see the Burch family alternating between the conquest of the games industry and the conquest of video game worlds. Anthony who was once a writer for Destructoid is now a lead writer at Gearbox, Ashly went from HAWP to professional voice acting, and Papa Burch...well Papa Burch doesn’t need to change a damn thing. What am I getting at? All three Burches are now homies that can be summoned to your aid in Saints Row IV. Awesome.

* **Final Fantasy 8 Finds a home on Steam** - [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/39150/)
> This is a weird thing and a lot of people got excited. Now if only they would re-release that other Final Fantasy game that everyone likes so much.

* **Self publishing on Xbox one could be a really big deal** - [Xbox.com](http://news.xbox.com/2013/12/xbox-one-developers-id-at-xbox)
> Due to the terrible marketing of the Xbox One pre launch, a lot of things about the console are underrated or overlooked. The ID@Xbox program could be one of the Xbox Ones saving graces. There is already a big list of developers signing up to publish and one of my favorite devs, Capybara Games, is among them. Giving developers an easy way to get their products to the masses is a key cornerstone for any platform and assuming Micrsoft’s new self publishing program can do everything they are promising, ID@Xbox could do a lot to win developer and fan support alike.

* **PS4 has sold over 2 Million Units** - [JoyStiq](http://www.joystiq.com/2013/12/03/sony-ps4-sales-rise-to-2-1-million-700k-sold-in-europe-austr/)
> I have a feeling the sales of the PS4 are the right position to make it one of the best selling consoles of all time. It’s way too early to say of course but both the Xbox One and the PS4 are breaking records in terms of video game specific hardware. One thing is certain though, more people are playing games than ever before in the medium’s history. That notion alone makes me really excited to see how things shape up over the next couple of years. Go video games!

* **Steam had 7 million concurrent users over winter sale** - [PC games N](http://www.pcgamesn.com/steam-breaks-7-million-concurrent-users-more-million-more-time-last-year)
> Anyone who says PC gaming isn’t relevant, is just not paying attention. Steam has a huge install base that certainly isn’t shrinking. On top of that Valve has new hardware coming out presumably in 2014 which only hopes to bring all enthusiasts who are playing games form their comfy couches. An untapped audience for the Steam Summer sale. You do the math.

###Comics:###
* **Magneto gets an ongoing series** - [BleedingCool](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/12/05/magneto-gets-an-ongoing-series-in-march-from-bunn-and-walta/)
> It’s been awhile since we had a Magneto series. If any character could support a continuing series it would be the master of magnetism. I got I high hopes for this book.

* **A new creative team and a new #1 for Wolverine and the X-Men** - [Newsarama](http://www.newsarama.com/19732-jason-latour-schools-wolverine-the-x-men.html)
> Another Marvel relaunch! The new creative team has some big shoes to fill, I’m hoping this series continues to be as good as its been in the past.

* **A new DC event in the making** - [BleedingCool](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/12/02/before-five-years-later-a-dc-earth-war/)
> We know that the next big DC event has been called “5 Years Later”, could DC have something else up its sleeve in the future?

* **Mark Millar’s new line of comics at Image** - [BleedingCool](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/12/02/mark-millar-confirmes-starlight-comic-with-goran-parlov/)
> Mark Millar, the writer of Marvel’s “Civil War”, “The Ultimates”, and co-creator of “Kick Ass” launches a new comic line that has been described as a “21st century Marvel Universe”, Can it live to to the hype?

* **Ghost Rider gets a new look and a new ride** - [ComicsAlliance](http://comicsalliance.com/ghost-rider-motorcycle-car-felipe-smith-tradd-moore-marvel/)

* **First look at Miracle Man’s variant cover** - [Newsarama](http://www.newsarama.com/19725-miracleman-1-jerome-opena-variant-1st-look.html)

* **Stan Lee tries again to claim  ownership of Marvel characters** -  [ComicsAllaince](http://comicsalliance.com/stan-lee-media-claims-ownership-of-marvel-characters-again/)
