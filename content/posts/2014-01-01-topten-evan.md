Each year we put ourselves through an almost agonizing game of favorites until only one game remains to sit atop that lofty Game of the Year Throne. It's never easy but after hours of pondering and internal debate I feel pretty strong about my choices and where they sit on my top ten list. What about you? Do you have a top ten list? Take a look at mine and let's compare!

**10. [Tearaway](http://tearaway.mediamolecule.com)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tearaway may not be my absolute favorite game of the year but it certainly is one of the most delightful games I have played in memory. The entire game world is made of paper craft and thrives on the player bringing their own paper creations to life. Tearaway animates beautifully and the music in the game feels one of a kind. In addition, Media Molecule's newest creation takes every feature of the Vita and uses it not for evil but for awesome.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of Tearaway's more unique features have you pushing your fingers into the game world to move objects around, tilting the Vita to move platforms, or finding collectibles that are actually instructions for creating real life paper craft. Using the camera in the game is also a ton of fun. Tearaway also makes great use of the Vita's front and rear facing cameras. Often you need a picture to complete a quest or restore color to the world and if you save up in game currency you can even buy cool lenses or filters for your camera. On top of that, all the picture you take can be uploaded to a website where you can manage them or share your favorites. I had a blast playing Tearawy.

**9. [The Wolf Among Us: Episode 1](http://store.steampowered.com/app/250320/)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telltale took home a slew of GOTY awards for Walking Dead last Year and although I think those awards are well deserved I think Wolf Among Us blows that stuff out of the water. I feel confident in that statement and I have only played one episode. However, that one episode spun me into a whirl wind of reading the games source material as fast as I could consume it. The game takes place before all the books which you may feel limits possibilities for the story to be it's own thing but so far I have found Fables comics and Wolf Among Us to be very complimentary.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the world of Fabletown so well realized in a 3D space is such a treat. The game's color pallet sets up a very vibrant and saturated world yet some how the there is a heavy sombre tone about it that lets you know, everything in Fabletown is not alright. That's where Bigby Wolf comes in. You play as the once hated Big Bad Wolf who is now tasked with keeping order in a secret town of fairy tale characters. In classic Telltale style your decisions have weight and the focus on story as a mechanic really sings in Wolf Among Us.

**8. [DMC: Devil May Cry](http://www.amazon.com/DMC-Devil-May-Cry-Playstation-3/dp/B007UM59L6)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I played the first Devil May Cry, really enjoyed it and then never played another DmC game until this one. After reading along for the years of drama behind a fan base scorned it seemed like the right time to jump back on board. The thing that really stands out to me when thinking back on DmC is the incredible combo system and angel / devil combat mechanic. Being able to cycle through an arsenal of weapons on the fly and mid combo feels fantastic and things really start to heat up when you are required to attack certain enemies with specific weapons.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the game I felt like I learned a great deal about DmC's layered fighting mechanics and yet there was still more to learn if my heart and fingers were ready. Aside from the combat, and strangely enough, above most things DmC excels at world building and storytelling. DmC contains some of the most unique and bizarre level design I have seen in a long while. A clever use of alternate realities has you doing some serious double takes when generic planes of reality transform into worlds flipped upside down or demonic soda factories. DmC is a well rounded game and it will have you jonsing for more by the time you scroll through the end credits.

**7. [Saints Row IV](http://www.amazon.com/Saints-Row-IV-Xbox-360/dp/B00BRQN2EM/ref=sr_1_1?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1388662588&sr=1-1&keywords=Saints+row+IV)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When THQ bit the dust I was worried. Hell, before THQ shut downVolition was already planning to transform the last DLC for Saints Row 3 into an entire game. In my mind there was no way a studio could pull that off and make an honest product people would be proud to own. I had a sliver of hope though and trust in Volition to pull it off...man, did they ever!?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players return to Steelport but this time with the voice of Nolan North and the adoption of all the best traversal elements from every open world game released in the last ten years. Having experienced Volition's versions of super jumping, power gliding, and super speed, is going to make it real hard to slog from one end of a digital world to another in any other open world game.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saints Row IV does more than modify existing mechanics to make a better game, it entirely re-imagines different ways to have fun in a Volition game. For example, incorporating Saints Row IV's fiction into how the game actually spawns and renders it's digital inhabitants. How about a radio station that just loops passages from Pride and Prejudice? I capped at level 50 and was forced to finish the game because I ran out of side missions to do. However, blowing stuff up with a gun that shoots black holes never really gets old. It might be time to start over and dig in all over again.

**6. [Need For Speed: Rivals](http://www.amazon.com/Need-Speed-Rivals-PlayStation-4/dp/B00D3RBZHY/ref=sr_1_1?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1388662619&sr=1-1&keywords=Need+for+Speed+Rivals)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t like racing games. Aside from color I barely even know the difference between cars when I see them on the freeway. I don’t even much care for Nintendo’s beloved Mario Kart. F-Zero GX is one exception but that's a story for another time. All that said, there is something about the way auto-log handles leader boards and stat tracking that appeals to me in the worst way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going off a huge jump only to see that one of my friends already hit that jump and landed few feet further than I did, keeps me up just that much longer trying to best the feat before turning in. I find myself spending hours trying to perfect a 3 minute race just to take that number one spot and ensure it will be a while before another friend takes the spot away from me. I still don't know much about cars but speeding around in Need For Speed: Rivals open world and staking territories is a lot of fun.

**5. [StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm](http://www.amazon.com/StarCraft-II-Heart-Expansion-Standard-Edition/dp/B002I0KP4G/ref=pd_sim_vg_1)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SCII: Wings of Liberty campaign is one of my favorite single player experiences of all time. Now seeing as my favorite race to play in the StarCraft universe is the Zerg, I had very high expectations for Heart of the Swarm. To be honest I was disappointed with how some of the single player campaign was handle but that doesn’t mean Heart of the Swarm is a bad game by any means. I enjoyed it a lot and it’s always fun to jump back into the Korpulu Sector and see what Raynor’s Raiders are up to.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The missions in HotS take on new structures and special objectives that have you eagerly collecting DNA to upgrade Kerrigan like you would a hero in a more traditional RPG. By the end she is a total beast but there is still a good balance of using the right mix of units to ensure victory. The new units are a blast and evolving old units like zerglings is a game changer even if sometimes it is just for the single player campaign. For' example giving the speedy little lings wings to jump up cliffs or allowing roaches to spawn mini roaches after falling in combat. . Alright now only like three more years until we see hide or hair of SCII: Legacy of the Void…

<img src='/images/forPosts/topten-mgr-revengeance.png' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
**4. [Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance](http://www.amazon.com/Metal-Gear-Rising-Revengeance-Playstation-3/dp/B002I0J8FI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1388662743&sr=8-1&keywords=mgs+rising)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut all the things. That’s what Konami said when the first Rising trailer was released. Not only were we promised that you can cut all the things but you can cut them any way you want. Well, a few of those promises fell short but it doesn't really matter because Metal Gear Rising is a fun from the time you pick up the controller until 4 or 5 in the morning when you find yourself putting it back down.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chopping up helicopters into teeny tiny pieces, running around like the Flash while deflecting bullets with a samurai sword, and some really ridiculous boss fights make all contribute to making MGR: Revengeance an overwhelmingly fun game to play but what does it for me is how seamlessly you can go from doing one of those things to the other. Kudos, Platinum games you guys are maniacs.

**3. [Guacamelee](http://www.amazon.com/Guacamelee-PS-Vita-Digital-Code/dp/B00GGUL67O/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1388662771&sr=8-2&keywords=gucamelee)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first heard of Guacamelee I knew it was going to be something special. Stellar music, a good sense of humor, responsive mechanics, and a unique art style go more than just a long way to making Guacamelee a great game. All of those things are carefully placed into the game that reinforce it’s tones and themes at every turn. This games got a lot of heart and you will too after you play it. Big ups to Drink Box studios for making this masterpiece. Guacamelee deserves as much love as was put into its creation and that’s a pretty tall order, so go check it out if you haven't.

**2. [Rogue Legacy](http://store.steampowered.com/app/241600/)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full disclosure: I never finished Rogue Legacy. At some point I have restarted the game three different times and put numerous hours into each play through. The sick thing is, I still want to play more Rogue Legacy. Part of it has to do with Glauber Kotaki’s phenomenal artwork. The other part just has to do with a mix of good old 2D side scrolling nostalgia and fantastic gameplay. Surely, I will pick this game up again as the new year begins...but alas a Vita version will soon be on it’s way and I find myself pondering another restart.

**1. [Last of Us](http://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Us-Playstation-3/dp/B007CM0K86/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1388662827&sr=8-1&keywords=last+of+us)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I almost wish that The Last of Us wasn’t at the top of my Top Ten list. Almost. The game certainly isn’t without faults but it’s hard for me to point to any other game released in 2013 that delivers satisfaction on as many levels as The Last of Us.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s telling when a game uses a heaping handful of the most wrought tropes in fictional storytelling but still delivers relate-able characters and a believable setting. Naughty Dog builds an incredibly believable world fraught with grim realities which help form the dynamic characters that live within it. Sure, getting ‘one-shotted’ by clickers in the beginning of the game is a harsh lesson learned, but the lethality of the games enemies increase the suspense and severity of every encounter. Justly, clearing an area without being detected or using found resources with just the right amount of finesse to pass through an area with minimal gunfire is incredibly gratifying.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, The Last of Us is one of the most well executed games I have played in the last ten years. From the way Elle hides under Joel’s arm when crouching behind cover to the incredibly well delivered dialog, there is a fascinating amount of attention to detail found throughout each aspect of the game. Rest assured the same amount of care was taken with the games take on multiplayer. Naughty Dog has certainly outdone themselves with The Last of Us so I can only hope they continue the trend going into 2014. Happy New Year.
