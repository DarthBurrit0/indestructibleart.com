2013 has been a wild year that flew by way too fast. The end of two consoles that have been the staple for the last 8 years. The debut of the Next Gen. 

####My Top Ten Games for 2013####

**10. DiveKick**  
I've never been good at Fighting games. They move too fast, and have crazy combo and block mechanics that I was never really able to fit my brain around. DiveKick takes all that down to 2 buttons, Dive and Kick. That's not to say that DiveKick is a simple or dumbed down version of a fighting game. All the nuance is there but with two buttons that even I can understand. If you are interested in Fighting games but are too intimated to jump in DiveKick is the perfect game to start your training regime.

**9. Ridiculous Fishing**  
I have two iOS games on my top ten list. Both are my opinion the best examples of game controls on iOS. Ridiculous Fishing takes motion controls to a precision thats a little bit amazing when looked at next to all of the thousands of other games in the appstore. It's bite sized twitch gaming that has endless hours of re-playability.

**8. Need for Speed: Rivals**  
Need for Speed Rivals was the one game available at launch of the PS4 that I could get behind spending 60 bucks on. Racing games aren't usually my thing but Rivals brings a sense of competitiveness that piqued my interest. The game is basically always online. You are matched with 5 other players at the start of each session, and while that doesn't always mean you'll come into contact with those players, the world is huge, when you do it's super fun. It's fast paced high adrenaline gameplay surprised me with the amount that I enjoy playing. Definitely a game I'll keep in rotation as I try and top all the Autolog Leaderboards.

**7. Device 6**  
Device 6 is a wonderfully unique experience on iOS. A choose your own adventure style storybook that wouldn't work anywhere else. Easily considered a must play if you have the means. iPad preferred over smaller screens.

**6. Gunpoint**  
Simple well designed gameplay mechanics. Clearly laid out levels with multiple solutions. Clever storytelling with funny dialog options. Gunpoint ties all these things together really well.

**5. Saints Row IV**  
Saints Row the Third was one of the most surprisingly entertaining games I've played in the past few years. So when Saints Row 4 came around I was pretty sure it was going to be one of the best things to play this year. While the main story wasn't quite as surprising as 3 it was still really ridiculous and entertaining and all the side stories really pulled it along. The gameplay tho, oh man. World traversal in SR4 is unmatched. Super jump into the air and fly across the sky. Super speed run faster than any car can drive. Hit the side of a building and start running straight up the side into a super jump into flying. What. Basically think "wouldn't it be fun if..." and you can do it in SR4.

**3. The Stanley Parable**

**2. Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds**  
It's simple, A Link Between Worlds takes everything that most people dislike about the recent editions to the Zelda franchise and sets them straight.
