    <p>Is there ever a time when East of West is not good? Seriously, Hickman and Dragotta's unique sci-fi opus is consistently one of the better titles being produced today. Just when I think I can try to figure out where the story is going, I'm constantly blindsided by insane plot points and cleaver character development.</p>
    <p>After getting a little more back story on Xiao and Death in last months issue, Hickman switches gears to spotlight the "Chosen" and introduces us to the Rangers. Hickman's knack for world building once again takes center stage to highlight just how grim this dystopian world is even without the threat of the four horseman of the apocalypse.</p>
    <p>As great as Hickman's writing is, Nick Dragotta's art is as equally compelling. Dragotta's fantastic use of perspective and character design is amazing. His ability to mix high tech gadgets and weapons with old west sensibilities give the book a look of it's own.Special credit has got to be given to colorist Frank Martin; his use of washed out colors and muted tones add so many layers to an already dense book which compliments the work that Dragotta has laid down.</p>
    <p>East of West is one of the more thought out and compelling series out there, and is easily the first title I read when it gets dropped in my pull list. The world of East of West has truly come to life over these past six issues, new readers can easily go and pick up the fist trade paperback that collects the fist five issues on line or at your local comic book store. Make it so! </p>
