# Spencer Carnage's Top 10 Video Games and Comics of 2013

You know the drill.

##10. [Hotline Miami](http://hotlinemiami.com/)

Something about this game makes you feel like you’re playing out an action scene in a Tarrantino movie. And that soundtrack! Man, does that thing groove. Every level is a one shot, one kill parade of violence that will have you pressing the X button over and over again as you restart the level, inching that much closer to the perfect dance of death needed to sweep through a couple of rooms full of bad guys.

##9. [Everything Together](http://www.amazon.com/Sammy-Harkham-Everything-Collected-Picturebox/dp/0985159502)

From serious to seriously funny, Sammy Harkham is a master of the craft. The way he moves between genres appears to be effortless and never disappoints. When illustrating tales of teenage indiscretion, Harkham breathes new life into what can often be a cliched narrative. Never thought a comic strip about Napoleon trying to be a cartoonist would be funny but Harkham convinced me otherwise.

##8. [Study Group Comics](http://studygroupcomics.com/)

##7. [Beta Testing the Apocalypse](http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/beta-testing-the-apocalypse-2.html?vmcchk=1)
<img src='/images/forPosts/spencer-top-10-2013-beta-testing-the-apocalypse.png' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
Tom Kaczynski's collection of short stories provide an important, poignant look into the modern world through a variety of interesting lenses: a young couple in a neighborhood on the brink of gentrification who struggle with their fascination-turned-obsession for a highrise condo that is erected right next door; a method actor embraces existent as a neanderthal when the role he plays in a film becomes more meaningful than his own life; the concept of a traffic jam as the frame that we live our lives within. The metaphors can be run a tad obscure, but Kaczynski nails them every time.

##6. [Pope Hats # 3](http://www.adhousebooks.com/comics/popehats3.html)
<img src='/images/forPosts/spencer-top-10-2013-pope-hats.png' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
Okay, yes. This comic came in 2012 but it wasn’t until 2013 that I read it, and by virtue of it being so very really much good, I’m including it. Remember when you read *On The Road* as a teenager, how it filled you up completely with the warmth that only comes from a first chance meeting with a kindred soul? *Pope Hats* is that kind of book, but for adults struggling with accepting the fact that growing up is a thing that is happening to them right at that very moment. Ethan Rilly’s two female protagonists, Victoria and Frances, wrestle with that space between being a child and being grown up in such a way that even in failure, they find success.

##5. [Bioshock Infinite](http://www.bioshockinfinite.com/)
<img src='/images/forPosts/spencer-top-10-2013-bioshock-infinite.jpg' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
An excellent first person shooter with a vibrant setting, enough mystery to keep you guessing, and the boss fights that can be difficult but not TOO difficult. This was my introduction to the *Bioshock* world and I now see why so many people love this franchise. Except for that part with the guitar. Someone should have been fired for that.

##4. [The Nao of Brown](http://www.naobrown.com/news/)
<img src='/images/forPosts/spencer-top-10-2013-nao-of-brown.jpg' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
Mental illness has never been exquisitely captured as it has in the *The Nao Of Brown*. Betweening battling her inner demons or escaping away into a manga-esque fantasy world, the protagonist Nao’s journeys are rendered beautifully by illustrator Glyn Dillon. At times this book was unsettling to read due to how well it captured the inner workings of Nao’s troubled mind but in the end, the journey was well worth it.

##3. [Nowhere Men](https://www.imagecomics.com/comics/series/nowhere-men)
<img src='/images/forPosts/spencer-top-10-2013-nowhere-men.jpg' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
When science is cooler than Rock n’ Roll, you send people into space and marvel at what happens when they change in ways man has never seen before. *Nowhere Men* covers the rise and fall of a four scientists using various magazine ads, inserts, and interviews that span their careers to tell their story and build the world around them. Add in an experiment on the edge of Earth’s orbit that goes frightening wrong and you have hit upon the recipe for a classic page-turner. This is the *Fantastic Four* comic that Hickman wished he could have written. 

##2. [The Last Of Us](http://www.thelastofus.playstation.com/)
<img src='/images/forPosts/spencer-top-10-2013-last-of-us.jpg' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
Joel is my dog. Thanks to Joel, Ellie, and their clicker wasting, “every man, woman, and child for themselves” survivalist killing spree, I have a rekindled love for Apocalyptic genre fiction. This game looks great and plays even better. While others deplored the wanton violence, I took solace in the fact that my youth spent reading *Punisher* and *Youngblood* comics properly prepared me to make the choices necessary to survive the end of times. 

##1. [East Of West](https://www.imagecomics.com/comics/series/east-of-west)
<img src='/images/forPosts/spencer-top-10-2013-east-of-west.png' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
Jonathan Hickman has done a number of good things in 2013, but his and Nick Draggota’s *East Of West* has been the best thing I have read these past twelve months. An alternate history where the West is still wild and the Four Horseman walk across North America in search of Death himself. Black arts, robotic lazer-face wielding horses, political infighting and intrigue, and a prophecy that seems to signal an end even more nasty than Armageddon itself, this book scratches itches like no one else out there. From the setting to the diverse cast of characters that navigate it, Hickman and Draggota’s *East Of West* is doing a bang up job of delivering a high concept story that has yet to disappoint.
