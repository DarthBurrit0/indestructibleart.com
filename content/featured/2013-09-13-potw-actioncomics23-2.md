    <p>Week two of DC Comics "Villains" month is upon us, and my pull list is now filled with 3D covers galore! Why many of these one shots have been hit or miss, I applaud DC for trying to get some of their lesser known characters out to the masses. While I enjoyed the Riddler and Darkseid issues, Action Comics 23.2 presentation of Zod was the real stand out this week. While I have never been a huge Zod fan, I have always respected the character and what he means to Superman and Krypton's mythology, plus who doesn't love the line "Kneel Before Zod!".</p>
    <p>Many of these "Villain" books have been updated origin stories to try and establish these characters within the blueprint of the "New 52", and Zod is no exemption. Greg Pak who has jumped head first into DC with "Batman/Superman" and his upcoming run in "Action Comics" crafts an unseen story that sets up the events that will ultimately lead Zod into the phantom zone before Krypton meets its unfortunate fate. Humanizing a villain always has its risks, but Pak gives us a Zod that his proud of his heritage and cares for the legacy of Krypton.</p>
    <p>Artist Ken Lashley proves to be quite the talent here in this issue. Drawing everything from the exotic locations of Krypton, to crazy Krpytonian armor and monsters, Lashley's art is perfect for this deeply rooted sci-fi story, and he got quite the knack for expressive facial features which adds an emotional depth to the characters.</p>
    <p>This issue was the biggest surprise this week, any preconceive notions I had about Zod as a character where thrown out the window. Greg Pak spins an intriguing character driven issue that will have you guessing why nobody has ever thought about telling a story of the man before he was a General.</p>
