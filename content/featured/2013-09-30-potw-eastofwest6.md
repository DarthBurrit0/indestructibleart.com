    <p>Is there ever a time when East of West is not good? Seriously, Hickman and Dragotta's unique sci-fi opus is consistently one of the better titles being produced this year. Just when I think I can try to figure out where the story is going, I'm blindsided by insane plot points and cleaver character development.</p>
    <p>After getting a little more back story on Xiao and Death in last month's issue, Hickman switches gears to spotlight the "Chosen" and introduces us to the Rangers. Hickman's knack for world building once again takes center stage to highlight just how grim this dystopian world is even without the threat of the four horseman of the apocalypse.</p>
    <p>As great as Hickman's writing is, Nick Dragotta's art is as equally compelling. Dragotta's fantastic use of perspective and character design is amazing. His ability to mix high tech gadgets and weapons with old west sensibilities give the book a look of it's own. Special credit has got to be given to colorist Frank Martin; his use of washed out colors and muted tones add so many layers to an already dense book which compliments the work that Dragotta has laid down.</p>
    <p>East of West is one of the more thoughtful and compelling series out there, and it's easily one of the first titles I fish out from my pull on a regular basis. The world of East of West has truly come to life over these past six issues. New readers can jump in easily by picking up the fist trade paperback which contains the fist five issues. Get it [online](http://www.amazon.com/East-West-Volume-The-Promise/dp/1607067706/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1380599580&sr=8-1&keywords=East+of+West) or at your [local comic book shop](http://www.hypnocomics.com). Make it so! </p>
