    It's gotten to the point that whenever I see a new Image #1 I have to pick it up. It's almost guaranteed to be something worth reading. To me Zero #1 totally lives up to that expectation.

        **We open in the not too far future.** Our lead, Zero, is an old grizzled man being held at gunpoint by a very young Agency operative. Then we take a step back and our lead goes into telling the story of how he got to this point in his life. Which takes us into the main story of this book. A flashback of how Zero started his turn away from The Agency, seemingly making this opening scene actually the end of the story.

        This young kid is young. Like 10 or 12 young. Zero mentions how he was 10 when The Agency had him make his first kill. So these people are being raised for work in The Agency? From birth? Bred maybe?

        Overall this issue feels like a spy story. Sneak in, acquire the target, don't get caught, leave no trace. But Ales Kot lead it out with a bit of Sci-fi. A "Biomodified" terrorist, who Zero is tasked with retrieving the tech that he has installed inside him, and another part machine man are duking it out. Zero needs to sneak in, grab the stuff and get out. Simple. But of course not. While trying to get close to the target we find out that not all the bystanders made it out of the area. By the end of the issue we see that one bystander gets killed in the mayhem of the machine mens' fight, pushing Zero to step outside his directives and lie to The Agency about how the mission went and starting he main thread this series will follow.  
        <br>
        So, old grizzled spy story plus some weird semi Sci-fi. A semi mysterious protagonist. The Agency being an unknown driving force behind our leads actions. The turn where Zero starts actively disobeying their orders. A defined time line for the arch to take place. All this seems like it could lead to compelling story telling.

    The art is simple and effective. Lots of bold lines and flat colors. It's definitely not as polished as some of my favorite artists right now, like <a href='http://comicsbeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/artofseanphillipsArt5.jpg' target='blank'>Sean Phillips</a> <a href='http://i179.photobucket.com/albums/w284/airhikec001/blog/comics/pages/AmericanVampire24_spread.jpg' target='blank'>Rafael Albuquerque</a> or <a href='http://vanishingpointchronicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/The-Wake-Scott-Snyder-Sean-Murphy.jpg' target='blank'>Sean Murphy</a>, but it feels like the same style and it totally works for me in this story's context.  
    <br>
    Oh, and it's pretty brutal. In that panel up there the one machine guy is ripping off that other machine guy's upper lip. With his teeth. Wild. The whole exchange between the machined up guys pretty much looks like that. Both guys inflicting more damage than the other should be able to endure, and the art style lends its self to that.

    I really enjoyed this issue as an introduction to the story. Issue 1 lays out the main arc, giving solid clues to the protagonist's motivations, while leaving enough mystery to fill out the rest of the series. I don't have any history with the writer, Ales Kot, so I can't tell you whether or not he can carry a story like this, but it does seem like there are enough building blocks already in place in issue one that I have a good feeling that it will carry through.

    <p class='sluglineCenter'> I'll be adding this to my pull.</p>
