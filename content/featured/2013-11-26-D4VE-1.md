    <p>What happens after the robot revolution hits the streets and all of humanity has been replaced by machines? They work menial jobs, stay in love-less marriages, and lament about days gone by. Basically, they're just like us.</p>
    <p>This first issue from <a href="http://www.monkeybraincomics.com/">Monkeybrain Books and Comics</a> provides an interesting setup: it is a future Earth much like our own, except everyone is a robot. <em>D4VE</em> takes place after a robot uprising that not only vanquished the entire human race but also fought off several alien offensives. Now that the dust has settled, the robots are living lives that mirror those of the humans they replaced. </p>
    <p>They fall in love and get married only to have their blissful matrimony turn loveless. They toil away in boring, corporate jobs, resent their bosses, and take long lunches getting drunk at the strip club. Homeless robots stand on the side of the road, holding up signs asking for charity in the form of oil while others walk their robo-dogs down the street. </p>
    <p>Enter the hero of our story: D4VE.  </p>
    <p>D4VE is a cross between Pixar's Mr. Incredible and Peter Gibbons from <em>Office Space</em>. His constant daydreaming of robot-monster fisticuffs only incur the wrath of his boss, who makes no bones about the fact that D4VE is practically worthless. At home, his wife S4LLY scorns him when his forgets to pick up a carton of oil on the way home from work. When D4VE isn't lost in thought, he slacks off by ditching work to get drunk at the local strip club. It's only after 14 hours of drinking with his co-worker CH4D that D4VE admits that all he really wants is to be cool again. With the appearance of a hostile menace towards the end of this issue, it seem like D4VE will get his second chance at the Defense-Bot lifestyle he misses so much.</p>
    <p>This is a great first issue. Writer and letterer Ryan Ferrier provides us with a smart and fun tale that plays with a familiar narrative in a new and interesting way. Never before have you cared so much about a slacker wage slave robot. Everything I have read with Ferrier's name on it (<a href="http://www.monkeybraincomics.com/titles/theremin/"><em>Theremin</em></a>, which he lettered) has been great and <em>D4VE</em> is no exception. The only complaint I have is that the issue itself ends on a weird beat but the quality of book makes it a forgivable mistake. Valentin Ramon's artwork is superb. Clean, technical, and precise, Ramon's line work reminds me a younger, less detailed Geof Darrow. And I love me some Geof Darrow. </p>
  <p>Together, Ferrier and Ramon have created an excellent must-read first issue of a series that everyone should be keeping their eye out for.</p>
