    <h5>Forever Evil #1 - DC Comics</h5>
    <p>Writer: Geoff Johns</p>
    <p>Artist: David Finch</p>
    <p>Inker: Richard Friend</p>
    <p>Colorist: Sonia Oback</p>
    <p>Letterer: Rob Leigh</p>

    <p>This week brought the first installment of DC’s first major event of the New 52, and it’s intense. Coming right off the heels of the Justice League Trinity War, Forever Evil introduces the world where the heroes of the Justice League have been beaten and the Crime Syndicate is in full control (While we don’t see the fates of the numerous Justice Leagues, it’s safe to say something went really wrong). </p>
  <br>
    <p>As we tend to see with many event books, the stories usually seem to start slow and build up over time, not so much here. Geoff Johns makes the right decision to ditch caution and to go for force with a first issue that leads to some exciting moments, plus a few surprises. It’s nice to see Johns taking some risks with established characters, and it will be interesting to see where he’ll take it from here. There is also a mention of an established character we haven’t seen yet in the new 52 that literally made me shout “Awesome”!</p>
  <br>
    <p>I have been waiting to see just what DC would do for its first big event of the New 52, and the first issue of Forever Evil doesn't disappoint. It wastes no time in delivering a high stakes story at every turn with a real sense of danger and impending doom that could really shake things up for the DCU. With a strong emphasis on the villains, Johns and Finch deliver a knockout punch while others are just jabbing when it comes to first issue event books.
