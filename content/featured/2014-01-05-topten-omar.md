2013 has been a wild year that flew by way too fast. The end of two consoles that have been the staple for the last 8 years, the debut of Next Gen, and just so many great games overall. I struggled a lot with which games would be on my top ten list this year, but I think this list ended up telling a pretty good story of Video Games for me in 2013. So without further delay, my Top Ten Games for 2013. Enjoy.


###10. DiveKick###
<img src='/images/forPosts/topten-divekick.png' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
I've never been good at Fighting games. They move too fast, and have crazy combo and block mechanics that I was never really able to fit my brain around. DiveKick takes all that down to 2 buttons, Dive and Kick. That's not to say that DiveKick is a simple or dumbed down version of a fighting game. All the nuance is there but with only two buttons the playing field is level in a way that even I can understand. If you are interested in Fighting games but are too intimidated to jump in, DiveKick is the perfect game to start your training regime.


###9. Ridiculous Fishing###
<img src='/images/forPosts/topten-ridiculousfishing.png' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
I have two iOS games on my top ten list. Both games represent the best examples of game controls on iOS. Ridiculous Fishing takes motion controls to a precision that's a little bit amazing when looked at next to all of the thousands of other games in the App Store. It's bite sized twitch gaming that has endless hours of re-playability.


###8. Need for Speed: Rivals###
<img src='/images/forPosts/topten-nfsrivals.png' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
Need for Speed Rivals was the one game available at launch of the PS4 that I could get behind spending 60 bucks on. Racing games aren't usually my thing but Rivals brings a sense of competitiveness that piqued my interest. The game is basically always online. You are matched with 5 other players at the start of each session. The entire game is played on a static open world map, which means you may always come into contact with those other players, but when you do it's super fun. Rivals fast paced high adrenaline gameplay surprised me with the amount that I enjoy getting behind the wheel and taking sharps turns in a fast car. Definitely a game I'll keep in rotation as I try and top all the Autolog Leaderboards. Oh and the cutscenes are freaking amazing.


###7. Device 6###
<img src='/images/forPosts/topten-device6.png' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
Simogo delivered two killer iOS games this year, Year Walk and Device 6. Device 6 is a wonderfully unique experience. A choose your own adventure style storybook that wouldn't work anywhere else. Part text adventure part audio visual puzzle that makes use of the hardware like nothing else I've seen so far. It's a game that makes you keep a notebook near by as you scroll through the narrative and uncover clues in the text, pictures or audio. Easily considered a must play if you have the means. iPad preferred over smaller screens.


###6. Gunpoint###
<img src='/images/forPosts/topten-gunpoint.png' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
Simple well designed gameplay mechanics. Clearly laid out levels with multiple solutions. Clever storytelling with funny dialog options. Gunpoint ties all these things together really well. The game is built to be tested and toyed with. Auto-saves happen every few seconds, giving you the freedom to try every possibility solving a room. Also you can punch dude, a lot, like a lot a lot.


###5. Saints Row IV###
<img src='/images/forPosts/topten-saintsrow4.png' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
Saints Row the Third was one of the most surprisingly entertaining games I've played in the past few years. So when Saints Row 4 came around I was pretty sure it was going to be one of the best things to play this year. While the main story wasn't quite as surprising as SR3 it was still really ridiculous and entertaining. All the side stories really pulled it along allowing you to familliarize self better with some familiar faces as well as some new ones. The gameplay tho, oh man. World traversal in SR4 is unmatched. Super jump into the air and fly across the sky. Super speed run faster than any car can drive. Hit the side of a building and start running straight up only to chain that action into another super jump only to resume flying across the sky once again. What. Basically think "wouldn't it be fun if..." and you can do it in SR4.


###4. Rogue Legacy###
<img src='/images/forPosts/topten-roguelegacy.png' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
For a little while now we've been living in a world of Rogue-lites, or Rogue-likes, or Rogue-likelikes, and it's all getting a bit out of control. Rogue Legacy's super tight controls and awesome art style makes it stand out from the crowd. I've put a lot of time into this game and while I still have yet to beat all the bosses, every run through the castle is just as entertaining as the first. You'd be hard pressed to find a game with more re-playability this year.


###3. The Stanley Parable###
<img src='/images/forPosts/topten-stanleyparable.png' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
I like The Stanley Parable a lot. I fought with myself for a long time about where on this list this game should land. It's got this undeniable charm that had me going back to it over and over again. The Stanley Parable is built around choice, and the branching narratives based on how you handle those choices. The narrator's dialogue makes you feel like they thought of every possible branch, which is insane. I feel like one of the hardest things to accomplish in gaming is giving players a sense that their choices are really making a difference to the story. The Stanley Parable definitely approaches this issue in a fun way that leaves you appreciating video games as a whole.


###2. Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds###
<img src='/images/forPosts/topten-zelda.png' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
It's simple, A Link Between Worlds takes everything that most people dislike about the recent editions to the Zelda franchise and sets them straight. A Link Between Worlds has received the highest praise from almost every outlet around, and it totally deserves it. The changes to the classic Zelda formula break up what usually becomes a stale and tired formula in a way that I never once felt the game dragging. If you have a 3DS you have to play this game, it's the best the handheld has to offer in a big way.


###1. Bioshock Infinite###
<img src='/images/forPosts/topten-bioshockinfinite.png' class='articlesImgCenter group'>
It's really hard for me to distill down what it is about Bioshock Infinite that makes it my top game this year. I really enjoyed everything it had to offer. I'm still a fan of the gun plus plasmid or vigor fight style, and when you add Infinite's skyhook system it takes the combat to a new level. The world design is unlike anything else I played this year. The floating city of Columbia is something that I enjoyed staring at for hours on end. If you take the time to search around, there seems to be an ‘infinite’ amount of small little details creating a more believable world that lives up to what the story is delivering.

The characters were superbly written and the story as a whole blew me away, but the game's ending is where Infinite really cemented itself as my top game this year. It's easy to pick apart multi-verse stories after the fact, but I really enjoyed what Irrational did with Bioshock Infinite. I had a lot of fun during the course of the game discovering what was really at work in Columbia, and the ending left me dumbstruck for hours afterward. Then for weeks I read theories online and chatted with friends and co-workers, and it was great. So much fun trying to squeak out as much from the game as I could. Its definitely one of the best games I've ever played and easily my top pick of the year.



####Notable Omissions####
* **Antichamber**
> I really want to play Antichamber, but it's only available for PC and I don't own a PC. Everything I've seen of the game looks amazing. I mean levels that rearrange themselves as you move around in the game?! Amazing.

* **Proteus**
> Proteus is definitely an experience that i really enjoyed this year. Its one of those games that some would argue isn't really a game, but you should just ignore all that garage and play it. Its something special.

* **Metal Gear Rising: Revengence**
> Revengence makes you want to scream "VIDEOGAMES!!!!!!" as you're playing it. Right from the start it lets you know what kind of ride this is going to be. If this was a top eleven it would have made the list.

* **Last of Us**
> I freely admit that should have finished The Last of Us, and if I had it would probably be pretty high up on my list. I just didn't like it enough to get passed the initial difficulty ramp up in the game. Maybe that says something about me, but I'm going to go with it says something about how the first quarter or third of that game played out.

* **GTA V**
> Everyone is always talking about how great GTA is. It just never really made it onto my radar. For whatever reason I'm just not into it. Anyways I have Saints Row for my open world fix and c'mon you know Saints Row is a better game.

* **Super Mario 3D World**
> I saw enough of  Super Mario 3D World to know its a great game. If i owned a WiiU it would probably be on my top ten list. It definitely pushes me closer to purchasing one.

* **Papers Please**
> Papers Please accomplishes something that few even attempt to do. It makes you feel like real garbage. It does it really well too.

* **Mirror Moon EP**
> Mirror Moon is really unique. A MMO in a way with systems full of undiscovered planets that you get to name as you solve the mysteries that they contain. It's played in seasons that reset to give everyone more and more to discover. I just wish that it helped you a little more getting started. There is a lot going on and it can be a little intimidating figuring it out.
